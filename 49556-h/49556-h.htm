<p class="center xl bold">COLLECTING AS A PASTIME</p>


<h2 id="REFLECTIONS">REFLECTIONS</h2>


<p>There is a cause for everything. Are antique collectors
born or are they made? Is the craze inherent, or do
circumstances or environment create the craving? How
in later life do early associations influence our peculiar
fancies? Possibly my seven years as a choir-boy at
Winchester Cathedral attending services and practices
there fifteen times weekly, being boarded at the Bishop’s
Palace, and playing games under the shadow of the ruins
of Wolvesey Castle may have laid impressions which
tended to render me susceptible to the mediæval. My
reflections bring to mind my singing at the enthronement
of Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, and seeing the bones of
King Rufus taken out of his tomb and laid in skeleton
form on the floor of the chancel. In those times a man
was not considered too old at forty, as the Dean was doing
his little bit at ninety. To go back still farther, when
quite a small boy I lay for weeks with a broken leg, which
had to be broken a second time owing to poor setting, in a
room out of which there was a secret chamber for hiding
those “wanted” in the good old days. This ancient
home with its pointed gables and windows was suitably
named “Gothic Lodge,” and is near Southampton, close
to a house in which Lord Jellicoe’s grandfather resided.</p>

<p>Anyone knowing Winchester will be familiar with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
picture of “The Trusty Servant,” and illustrative of the
extraordinary things a collector may come across in his
rambles, I found a good print of this in a nice old maple
frame hanging in a dark shop of a dingy street in a drab
town in the North of England, and, of course, I purchased
it (<a href="#PLATE_II">Plate <span class="smcap2">II</span></a>, facing p. 14).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The rostrum shook under the thud of the fist of the
reformed prizefighter, and the hall reverberated with his
stentorian exclamation. “Ah-h-h-h, my friends, what
will the drunkard do for drink?” Allow me just to
whisper, “What won’t the collector do for curios?” It
is generally understood that there is honesty among
thieves. This may be so&mdash;not being a member of that
fraternity I cannot vouch for its accuracy. That this
desirable attribute prevails amongst the majority of
antique dealers and collectors is to my mind open to
question. You know you cannot do yourself justice
unless you know more than the other fellow, while he
in his turn, if you are a stranger, treats you with suspicion,
and so you both play Brer Rabbit.</p>

<p>I was once going through a collection acquired by
a professional gentleman, and he called my special
attention to a very good figure of Nelson, which he
informed me he had obtained at a bargain price. The
figure was in a shop run by an alien, probably now a
naturalised Englishman, who asked fifteen shillings for it.
On its being pointed out that the figure only possessed one
arm the alien said he had not noticed that and dropped
the price to eighteenpence. I suppose, after all, this
question of honesty resolves itself into a matter of con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>science,
and we must realise that this is a commodity
liable to degrees of elasticity which can be regulated
without a great deal of effort to suit the demand requisite
for the occasion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Did you ever know a collector give away anything
from his special line? I once had a little Leeds Pottery
cottage (impressed mark) pressingly offered me out of
pure good will by a dealer, who although he was only half
a collector was a whole-hearted Christian, and I wish he
were still in the flesh to read this fond reference to his
genial urbanity, but he has gone aloft.</p>

<p>Open confession is good for the soul, and I feel at this
point I must unburden my conscience after alluding to
others whose feelings may have been disturbed by my
theories. On one occasion a very old and valued friend
was giving a charity bazaar at his residence, so he asked
me to contribute some of my old pewter. My friend and
I had much in common, but he little knew what he was
asking of me then or with what pangs of heart-burning
those twenty pieces were selected, packed, and forwarded,
with a lying letter expressing the pleasure I felt.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One other outstanding instance of generosity comes
vividly to my mind. Early on, when I could talk of
nothing but old pewter, I spent an afternoon with a
friend who still resides in a hamlet, the name of which I
Aughton’t to disclose. He specialises in old porcelain
and young pullets, together with rare bits and roses.
At the time I was almost in despair because I could drop
on no pewter dishes. Imagine my delight when I received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
anonymously three good marked specimens from the
residential district aforesaid. On meeting the donor and
overwhelming him with my profusion of gratitude, he
remarked, “Look here, old man, you needn’t make such
a fuss about it. The fact is my wife came across these
dishes when spring cleaning, and she asked me to get
them out of the way, so I sent the bally things off to you.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have alluded to the influence the collecting craze may
have on the conscience, and on the gift of charity. The
bump denoting the latter varies very considerably in
individuals, as in some cases it is reported to be undiscernible
by the most gifted phrenologist, yet we each
think our own so abnormally developed that we wonder
how we keep our hats on. As an instance of the way in
which the mania may take hold of the common sense contained
in a brain occupied with big undertakings, and
large financial questions, let me give you an instance.</p>

<p>At a shop on Blackpool Pier I noticed an oak pulley-block
partly gilded, and learnt it had belonged to the
rigging of the <i>Foudroyant</i>, which was wrecked there in 1897.
Although I did not want this myself I knew a friend who
would like to have it. He was very keen on Nelson
relics, and had shown me with pride the room he devoted
specially to the display of these, which he had accumulated
regardless of cost. I purchased the block for a guinea,
packed it up, sent it off to the South of England by
passenger train, and wrote saying what I had done.
What gigantic schemes matured or what h.p. pressure was
required to keep his powerful brain under control, I
do not know, but in the evening of the following day I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
received an urgent telegram saying the pulley-block had
not yet arrived, and would I trace it forward? Now
why could not a man of his experience and resource have
waited more than twelve hours after getting my letter for
a thing like that to come 250 miles by train, without
giving me extra trouble, when I had already put myself out
of the way to give him a little pleasure? I forgave him
when I received his note of thanks, and he never met me
afterwards without referring to my thoughtfulness on his
behalf.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Soon after I started I had the advantage of comparing
notes with a medical friend, who had a decided
penchant for antiques, and he diagnosed collecting as a
disease on which he considered himself an authority, if
not a specialist, as his knowledge had been acquired by
constant practice. His faculties were so acute that
on one occasion while feeling the pulse of a patient he
lost count of the beats through catching sight of a
Bartolozzi print hanging near the bed. He was pleased
to say the patient recovered her health, and he obtained
the Bartolozzi.</p>

<p>Further evidence in support of this theory is the case
of a minister who, after seeing my collection for the first
time, could not sleep, but lay awake wondering in which
of the houses in his parish he had seen any pewter. May
I not carry this a step further without giving offence, by
suggesting that when thoughts require to be concentrated
on less worldly things, while paying his consoling visits he
should spend much of the time with both eyelids closed?
Be this as it may, he has secured a number of bargains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Another instance came under my notice through
seeing a letter from a wealthy merchant, the ramifications
of whose business are world-wide, in which he stated
he had been poking about slums, and had picked up two
pepper-pots for a few coppers. Consequently he could
not see his way to offer more than three shillings for two
which had been advertised for four shillings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have discovered among my press cuttings an article
which appeared in the <cite>Times</cite>, August 12, 1910, and I
should like you to read the following extract:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bq">

<p class="center">ON COLLECTORS</p>

<p>“The collector’s instinct seems to be a curious by-product
of the human mind; and not only of the human mind, for
magpies, monkeys, and even dogs, sometimes have it. When
a dog makes a store of bones, old and entirely fleshless, he is
like the collector who keeps obsolete things just because they
are obsolete. A used postage stamp is to a man what a bone
without flesh is to a dog; but the collector of postage stamps
goes further than the dog, in that he prefers an old postage
stamp to a new one, while no dog, however ardent a collector
of bones without flesh, would not rather have a bone with
flesh on it. Yet there is more method in the human collector,
since he always has before him the ideal of a complete
collection, whereas no dog, probably, ever dreamed of
acquiring specimens of all the different kinds of bones there
are in the world. This ideal of a complete collection is the
usual spur of the human collector; and often he will collect
the most out-of-the-way things in the hope of attaining it.
But there is also the spur of rivalry, and because of that there
are not many collectors of things that no one else collects.
Every collector likes to have at least one rival whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
may out-do, and from whom perhaps he may steal; for the
collector’s instinct is sometimes too strong for the most
honest of men, so that they come to regard stealing as only a
bold and skilful kind of collecting. They would never steal
anything except what they collect; but in stealing a fine
specimen they are only rectifying the iniquity of chance
which has given that specimen to an ignoramus who does
not deserve it. For them collecting is a game, and stealing
is not a breach of the rules. Indeed, there is only one breach
of the rules, viz.:&mdash;forging. But even forgeries make
collecting more exciting; and perhaps they are not really a
breach of the rules, but only an added complication in the
game, a new kind of bunker, so to speak, which tests the
skill of the player.”</p></div>

<p>Great minds think alike! Oh, thank you!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In my numerous calls I have only once been openly
treated with suspicion, and that happened in a county
town which boasts of an imposing jail. Possibly the
existence of that massive pile with its undesirable inmates
had given cause to the local antique dealer to be ever
doubtful of his visitors. My friend and I had left the
motor at the hotel, found a small shop crowded with
antiques, opened the door, which was of the stable pattern
in two sections, and walked in. After a few minutes,
during which we were examining curios, and making
audible comments, the proprietor came out of the back,
and demanded to know how we got in.</p>

<p>“Through the door.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but why didn’t you ring the bell?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the bell is out of order.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, that won’t wash, I know your sort.”</p>

<p>He was irate, so we left him in possession. My friend
was very indignant, and was not appeased when I hinted
that the unpleasant incident would not have occurred if I
had been by myself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I do not envy those who go to auction rooms or large
antique premises, buy a cart-load in one afternoon, write
out a cheque, and have the goods kecked at the door
like a load of coal. I have always been pleased that I
started and have kept on buying my finds in penny
numbers, and now I am able to put them in volume form
I am well rewarded for my persistence.</p>

<p>Like the lady who never made her tea the right
strength, because she had a poor eye for measuring
distances, I attempt no estimate of the miles I have
travelled in pursuit of the game. I have motored as far
north as Dunbar with success, made discoveries in Dover,
found dishes in Devonshire, turned up treasures when
touring the Lakes, and been over to Ireland for pewter.
Reflections on these journeys are constantly arising as
my eye lights on one or other of the numerous specimens
which adorn my home, and I am truly thankful that I
turned my attention to the collecting of antiques in the
way I have done, thereby providing myself with a pastime
which has been beneficial to the body and mind of a busy
man.</p>

<p>In my narration I hope I may not cause the reader to
conclude that I am egotistical, desirous of creating the
impression that I know it all, make no mistakes, and
pick up nothing but bargains. I must plead guilty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
having on more than one occasion when homeward
bound thrown rotten purchases out of the train, taking
care, of course, not to hit any resting man working on the
line. There have been times when on closer scrutiny
I have discovered an “antique” purchase to be modern,
and I have turned it over to the hazards of everyday
use, feeling sure that its existence among the household
effects would not remain in evidence for a lengthy
period to remind me of my lack of acumen.</p>

<p>By giving some of my experiences the amateur who,
like myself, has essayed to go cautiously will, I feel, enter
into the spirit which has pervaded my search after
antiques to get what enjoyment there was to be obtained
in pursuit of the elusive bargain. An ounce of practice
is worth a ton of theory, and a few mistakes are the best
school for the student.</p>

<p>I hope in the contents evidence of originality may
occur, and that the touches of humour may not be considered
misplaced, even by those who take their collecting
very seriously. I have the good fortune to number
among my friends one who for half an ordinary lifetime
has been so keen a collector of antiques that he has
gathered together a host of treasures which have not only
filled his house from ground floor to garret, but have
partly stocked the local museum as well. He must have
read nearly everything published on his beloved subjects,
and when he heard I had decided to write this book, in an
encouraging letter he said, “I shall, I know, be very much
interested. I love to read a ‘spicy’ article. I always
think it sinks deeper than the heavy and often cumbersome
accounts we sometimes get.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>I have not enquired just what my friend’s definition of
the word “spicy” may mean, but as he knows half my
pleasure in collecting is the fun of the thing, and that it is
my natural bent to find humour whenever it chances to
come my way, I trust he will not be disappointed with the
result of my efforts to enliven what he might otherwise
have considered another addition to heavy material.</p>

<p>I hope the illustrations will give satisfaction. Long
before I started collecting I was possessed of a good half-plate
camera, with a fine lens, which I used out in the open
on any occasion as I felt disposed, consequently this
experience came in most useful when I desired to photograph
specimens of my collection indoors. I have therefore
not only the satisfaction of knowing that all the
subjects exhibited have been gathered together by my
initial effort, and are all under my own roof, but that I
have taken most of the photographs myself. The result
of taking all these on half-plates has allowed me to keep
uniformity running through the book, and enabled me to
present the pictures the right way up. The arrangement
in so many volumes which compels each reader to twist
the book every time he wishes to study a picture, will be
found practically absent in this. As the smartly set up
autocratic adjutant commands his regulars “Right-turn”
and “Left-turn” so does the short-sighted conservative
author compel his readers to “Read-turn” and “Lift-turn.”</p>

<p>I take no credit for the developing, printing, or
toning of the photographs, for I have a detestation of
shutting myself in the dark room, and a dislike for the
tedium of the remaining part of the process. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
arranging a set of shelves for the groups, and fixing the
camera at the most suitable distance I have maintained
the same proportion of size throughout, a point which
should be borne in mind as one which has saved the
necessity of giving more than a few measurements. The
times of exposure for the photographs have varied from
two minutes to two hours.</p>

<p>Collecting, therefore, has livened up my photography;
and it is fresh in my mind that photography has livened
me up on two occasions while I have been on this work.
The first when, after hanging about for twenty minutes
while a “grandfather” was reflecting his face, I found I
had omitted to take the cap off the camera. Secondly,
when another “grandfather” was supposed to be
undergoing the required operation, I discovered after the
lapse of a similar period, which seemed to be about double
the time, that I had forgotten to pull up the slide, and
this happened just when the necessary light for that day
had finished. Such incidents as these are by the way, but
the linking up of photography with the still life that is
depicted is a further justification for the title “Collecting
as a Pastime.”</p>

</div>


<p class="mt1">“The oak tree was an acorn once,” and so was the case
of my first grandfather clock. Quite by chance in
1902, I noticed in a shop window a brass dial bearing the
inscription “John Burgess de Wigan,” with well-engraved
numerals, and fitted with quaintly cut brass hands. On
enquiry I was told they had a case for it, and this was
found propped up, for its feet were groggy. As 17s. was
the price asked for the lot, I plunged. To my amazement
an old clockmaker soon had the works going and
he assured me they would see me out, but I have some
anxiety about the original wrought iron hinges, which I
compute will have swung, back and to, nearly 90,000
times.</p>

<p>The minstrel (Moore and Burgess) sang that “the
grandfather clock was too tall for the shelf, so it stood
ninety years on the floor.” My old gentleman had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
evidently been in more confined space than this one they
made such a song about, and as the owner could not bend
its back he knocked off the feet. I fitted him out with
new understandings made of very old timber, which
suited him down to the ground. When the case was
renovated the venerable timekeeper was placed in my
hall, where he has ticked away regularly except on those
days when his rope has not been wound up, or when a
new rope was necessary. I found, by starting a correspondence
in the <cite>Wigan Observer</cite>, that Burgess was one of
the earliest clock-makers in Wigan, and that my clock was
made about 1690.</p>

<p>The first long-case pendulum clock was made by
Thomas Tompion in 1681 and the prefix “de” to names
was dropped about 1700, so it would be interesting to
know how many clocks are still in existence bearing the
“de” in front of the surname. I have had clocks
offered to me said to be 300 or 400 years old, while one
man thought his would be at least 500; when I stated
that I had read in my clock book that 240 years was the
limit he disdainfully brushed that opinion aside with the
remark, “Oh, books! Do you believe all you read?”</p>

<p>This was the antique seed that has spread from hall
to room, and from room to room, until there is no room
for more. Strange to say, within a week I had found a
companion to “old Burgess” in the form of a very
ancient oak Ecclesiastical chest, bearing four locks
without wards, but with each key-hole a different
shape; the keys to correspond would be in the hands of
the parson, two wardens and sexton respectively (<i>See</i>
<a href="#PLATE_VIII">Plate <span class="smcap2">VIII</span></a>). The clock and the chest have stood <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
since their introduction, and if the regularity of the
former and the complacency of the latter had been
emulated by the occupants of the house, what a model
home they would adorn!</p>

<p>It is believed that on one occasion “old Burgess”
forgot to strike, for which he may be forgiven. On the
newel post there is fixed a fine old bronze female figure,
bearing a light, and on the occasion of a young cleric
spending the night with us this statuette was found
draped in a Varsity blue wrap (the owner of which has
since served as an Army Chaplain throughout the War)&mdash;truly
a sight to set any decorous time-server off his
balance! (<a href="#PLATE_I">Plate <span class="smcap2">I</span></a>.)</p>

<p>This model of the female form divine deserves an
artistic treatment, to which I do not feel competent to do
justice, but I opine the modeller, L. V. E. Robert, who
was doing his level best about sixty years ago, intended
it to be a representation of “Summer,” or “Hygeia,”
and that he was proud to impress his name thereon.
It stood for years in a mansion, and was turned out
into the cold when the premises were altered on
changing owners, so I then found it a home.</p>

<p>I was very proud of “old Burgess” (and am still) and,
of course, called the attention of all our visitors and the
piano-tuner thereto. This musical fiend struck a discordant
note when he piped out, “I see it’s only a 30-hour.
I have one that belonged to my wife’s great-aunt and it
has an eight-day movement, which is so much more
convenient.” There are some people who seldom do, and
never say, the right thing. That set me on looking for an
eight-day grandfather, and I looked in vain, and for fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
I might strain my sight I confided my absolute requirement
to a friend who knocked about the country, and
he assured me at once he could soon fix me up, “but
what price will you go to?” As I wished to give him
as little trouble as possible I said, “Oh, I’m not particular,
say fifty shillings.” One morning not long after this the
commissionaire announced in my office that two gentlemen
wanted to see me in the hall&mdash;a marble hall, mark
you!&mdash;and here I found my friend looking very worried,
with a man who touched his forelock, but to whom I was
not introduced. They had with them something that
bore resemblance to a coffin with a dirty shroud, the latter
having apparently twisted itself round the former, a
state of packing that no estimable undertaker would
undertake. They then proceeded to unshroud and prop
up the outer shell, which had three sides and a bit.</p>

<p>“The case is the nearest match I could get to your
thirty-hour; and the dial and works are in the box
there.”</p>

<p>“But where is the back?”</p>

<p>“I can’t exactly say; some is on the Birmingham platform,
some at Stafford where I changed, there is quite a
lot on the platform here, and I noticed pieces kept
falling off as I followed this man wheeling it from the
station; but whoever looks at the back of a clock?
You can easily fit in another without anybody being the
wiser.”</p>

<p>I then saw the dial and works, and found I was face
to face with Grandfather Philip Smith of Barton, which
Barton I cannot say, but probably near Nottingham.
I did my best for him, and he has done his best for me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
so I am recompensed for the expense I was put to in
renewing his youth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Sergeant, just sweep up that dust in the hall.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I now received a welcome gift of two high-backed
Lancashire Cromwellian black oak chairs from a revered
friend, who was wishful to encourage my new craze, and
very useful and instructive these have been. I say
instructive, for they had not been in the shadow of
“old Burgess” long before I compared the grain of their
oak and his, with the result that while the panel in the
back and front leg spindle of one was finely carved, and
the oak undoubtedly 17th century, in the other they were
as modern as the frames. I may here mention for the
benefit of any reader who does not know that old oak
furniture is seldom black with age, and that the polisher
can stain it any shade preferred, that when Nelson’s
flagship, the <i>Foudroyant</i>, built in 1797, was wrecked at
Blackpool in 1897, much of her oak was made into
furniture, and some fine chairs quite light in colour may
be seen at the Hotel Metropole there. I have a black
gate-legged table made from <i>Foudroyant</i> oak which is an
exact replica of a good Cromwellian design with twisted
legs, and which was quite light in colour until it was
stained (Plates <a href="#PLATE_X"><span class="smcap2">X</span></a> and <a href="#PLATE_XI"><span class="smcap2">XI</span></a>).</p>

<p>I now had another oak grandfather clock with a brass
dial offered me, and although it had a thirty-hour movement
I did not hesitate to pay the price asked. It had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
come from Ormskirk, where it was made by T. Helm
about 1770, as in the Constable’s book of accounts for that
year there is an entry “paid Thos. Helm for taking care
of clock.” It stood for a hundred years in a farm opposite
my house, and I got it from descendants of its original
owners, so for sentimental reasons I would not part with
it, even at an advance on the first cost. This clock
originally was worked by a rope, but a chain was substituted
before I became its possessor. I have other things
to talk of than grandfather clocks, but three were not
enough for me. I have from time to time provided
room for others, and for the last few years have found
nine none too many, as seven of them need winding only
once a week. They do not all strike at once, for a few
have been deprived of their capacity for music-making,
by having the striking weight taken off.</p>

<p>By the aid of the photographs and with the following
particulars the reader has a fair illustration of the evolution
of the external part of grandfather clocks extending
over one hundred years. I believe the dates I estimate
are not far off the mark, and I hope some readers may be
enabled to set their minds at rest if they have been in
doubt as to the age of their own grandfather.</p>

<p>So far as I know the nine clocks are genuine. I could
find no trace of any material repair before I got them, and
I have been most careful in the renovating which was
necessary with some of them. I ought to explain in
regard to “Phillips” that I fell in love with him in an
auctioneer’s stock-room because his style seemed just to
agree with my oak dresser and I bought him, although he
was fitted with a 30-hour movement which was quite worn
out. Having obtained the works of an old eight-days
by buying a white dial in a case I cared nothing about, I
had two holes drilled in “Phillips’” face and so converted
him. It was a simple thing to do, as the centre of the dial
is matted without engraving and the centres could be
made anywhere to correspond with the requirements of
the winding arrangements. This is an example of what
may happen to old clocks when in the dealer’s hands. I
have been in places where a number of old grandfathers
have been in stock, and changing a good dial which
would suit a better case was considered quite the proper
thing to do, but consequently the grandfather would in
future bear a wrong cognomen, while the case might be
quite of a different date from that indicated by the
maker’s name.</p>

<p>“Former Clock and Watch Makers,” by Britten, was
my text-book for this department, and I must have
given my friends the impression that I was an authority
on horology, for on reflecting I find I purchased, selected,
or had a hand in the choosing of about thirty grandfather
clocks. Narrow cases and brass dials were my
usual stipulations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>


<h3>LACQUER CLOCKS</h3>

<p>Lacquer clocks have increased greatly in value
recently on account of their scarcity. About twelve
years ago I had one offered me for £4 10s., but as I did
not admire it, and had no idea where I could get the
needed repairs executed, I left it alone. I have just seen
one sold by a dealer to a dealer for £37. On my last
visit to see a collector and dealer, whom I respect for his
straightforward dealing, I found he had parted with his
lacquer clock, which I had seen in his room for many
years, and was told a dealer had tempted him to sell it
for £50, and that he now realised he had practically
given it away at this price.</p>


<h3>BAROMETERS</h3>

<p>Having provided for reliable time-keeping, my next
requirement seemed to be something experienced in ruling
the weather. I found my first antique barometer hanging
outside a tall warehouse, when out cycling with a friend.
This emporium was a three-storeyed building, filled
with all kinds of “rubbish,” valuable and otherwise.
While my friend studied the old books I poked about and
made my first purchase of old china and old pewter, but
these will be dealt with on other pages. I made further
visits to this building, which now forms a portion of the
offices of a very large soap works, and think if I had
known anything about old engravings I might have
found something worth while. I feel sure there were
many fine works hanging promiscuously on the walls, for
they comprised some of the ugliest and most weird things
in pictures I have come across.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>That barometer has been a tried and trusted indicator,
and I was so pleased with its usefulness that I thought
it would be a good idea to get another, and fix it in the
precincts of the kitchen, so that the laundress might
know the right time to hang out the clothes. Having
bought another of the good old type, and having found just
the place for it, I next gave careful instructions to the
female mind which had to cope with the laundry department
as to the reading and the adjusting of the indicator,
so that the fine drying days could be intelligently anticipated,
and I figured out the saving of coal effected
would soon pay the modest cost of the barometer many
times over, but the affairs of men and mice and charladies
aft gang agley. I was not long in noticing that
barometer No. 2 did not work in accord with No. 1, and I
worried about it, in fact at the time of writing I am still
worrying about it. There is a cause for everything, and
when things go wrong it is necessary to find out the reason
before they can be put right, and when the discovery
is made you can fix the blame where any may exist.
Imagine the shock I experienced one day when I found
that the maid had been in the habit of taking the instrument
down, and laying it flat on the table to give it a good
polishing. Where the mercury slipped to is a mystery,
but I must admit that I never gave her warning that an
antique barometer when charged must be kept perpendicular.
The instrument went to be refilled with
mercury soon after the War started, and has not been
returned to me yet!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>


<h3>DRESSERS, CHAIRS, ETC.</h3>

<p>The next antique furniture I desired was an oak
dresser to show off the pewter which had been accumulating,
and I was fortunate in obtaining one, which originally
had come from Wales, without delay. The oak proved
to be elm, but I bought it without first seeing it, and I
have been pleased that it turned out as it did. The
inverted pediments are of holly and the doors work on
pins. To get the dresser out of the farm where it had
played its part for generations, the farm door jambs had
to be removed, so I was informed, but it just fitted my
hall, which was all that really mattered.</p>

<p>Another dresser was reported to me as having come
from Wales, and I bought it from a Mr. Jones, and
although I had not seen this until it came to me, it was
good old oak sure enough. I believe the elm-made dates
from early in the seventeenth century, and the oak one
about fifty years after.</p>

<p>These old dressers were complete, but one had a
portion of the back decayed, probably through standing
for years against damp walls, so an obliging builder let
me have some boards sawn from an oak beam he had
taken out of an ancient Quakers’ meeting-house, and I was
able to maintain the true character and charm of these
time-worn stagers.</p>

<p>The Chinese Chippendale chair (<a href="#PLATE_X">Plate <span class="smcap2">X</span></a>) deserves
special notice, for was it not my initial find in mahogany?
Its home was in a building the walls of which were feet
thick, and in generations past had formed part of a
monastery, but which to-day is linked up with a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
modern dwelling built of the same Scotch grey stone. It
was in this house, near Dalkeith, while we were having
a family holiday in the summer of 1906, and just when
my soul was awakening to the mysteries of antiques, that
I came across this relic. It stood in the room we occupied
in the ancient part of the building, and was completely
disguised by a covering of chintz, hiding strong canvas
stitched over much padding. After lifting its skirt,
peculiarly shaped legs were revealed, and my curiosity
was aroused. Removing the chintz cover, by ripping off
the canvas, and taking out about a sackful of wool, I
was not only struck by the unique back, but astounded to
find the original pig-skin upholstery in good condition.
One mahogany arm was missing, and a very rough hard
wood substitute had been fitted in its place. I was
presented with the chair on the spot. A handy man
from the village fetched “a wee bit o’ auld mahogany bed
stock he had just sawed off to mak anither haundle for
the chair.” I got him to make a case to hold it, and the
“wee bit bed stock,” together with a spinning-wheel, and
consigned it for home to await my arrival. I learnt
“there was anither chair like it awa doon at Melville
Castle.”</p>

<p>The spinning-wheel just mentioned was noticed by my
wife when making a purchase of wool in a shop on
Causewayside at Edinburgh, and she was told, “my mon
had brocht it wi’ him on his last journey from Yell” (the
most northern of the Shetland Isles), and although it was
not for sale she “didna mind parting wi’ it, as she could
aye git anither yen when her mon gaid for mair wool.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>When wanting more chairs I noticed a set of spindle-back
rushed seats with pony feet, and on enquiry was told
they had “one arm and six ordinary.” Ere learning the
price I was asked, “How many do you want?” The
idea of splitting a set of chairs over a hundred years old,
and in perfect condition! Yet this is an indication of the
value placed on this type fifteen years ago, while to-day
dealers are scouring the country-side to make up sets.
I gleaned that these were made by the grandfather of our
local house furnisher; he (the grandfather) had six sons,
and kept a farm, also a wheelwright’s shop in the country;
that the chairs were made in the dark evenings for a few
shillings each, so I got them at about their original
price; that the wood used was oak from an adjoining
park, and after dressing it was stained mahogany in a bath,
that the spindles were driven home with the wheelwright’s
hammer, and that “Uncle Richard was the finest rusher
in Lancashire.” This is undoubtedly true, for there is
not a spindle loose or a rush out of place. (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate <span class="smcap2">IX</span></a>)</p>

<p>After buying the spindle-backs, on the same day and
in the same street I visited another broker’s shop, but let
me direct you in case you wish to call there any time.
It is situated either higher up or lower down, according
to which end of the street you enter by, but if you come
out of a by-street you must be careful to turn either to the
right or left, and keep straight on, for if you cross over
and go ahead you will be up another street. Should you
be walking you will keep to the right, but in case you drive
or motor you must mind and keep to the left. Trams
pass the door, and if you take the one going to Liverpool
you will not get anywhere near it. It is situated on the
opposite side facing a shop that has been “To Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>”
but is now occupied by a tradesman who has done well
out of the war. By the by, if you happen to come in the
evening, and take the North Star as your guide you will
no doubt find the place&mdash;shut up. Readers can take so
much more interest in a story when they have been made
familiar with the locality, and especially in a case like this
where the actual house has been pointed out. I entered
the shop&mdash;do you follow me? I examined a birch chair
with a broken arm, an artistic back, fluted legs, and a
rush seat. While I am ruminating, the broker comes
out of his parlour, leaving the door open, and I see other
chairs of the same pattern, which are evidently in everyday
use. I remark on them, and am invited to inspect.
Having done so I enquire, “Will you sell them?” and
am answered thus&mdash;“Will I sell ’um, I’ll sell you every
old thing I’ve got.” I did not buy every old thing he’d
got, but I secured the set of chairs, two arm and six
ordinary, and when re-polished the figuring of the birch
looked well. I also relieved him of a mahogany pedestal
circular mirror, which I “could have for seven bob, as
he was tired of seeing the thing about.” (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate <span class="smcap2">IX</span></a>)</p>

<h3>MAHOGANY GATE-LEGGED TABLE</h3>

<p>My having over-stocked the house that day has kept
me off buying higher class chairs, but one never knows
what may happen. Quite recently I bought a gate-legged
Spanish mahogany square ended table. I found
it most unexpectedly the first day we decided we wanted
such a thing, and it happened to be just the size desired.
After a brief examination without going on my knees I
told them to deliver it, and when it arrived legs uppermost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
I thought, “what a lot of worm holes for the money.”
I said nothing aloud. Having ’phoned for a cabinet-maker,
and after he had laid the table top downwards
he dropped on his knees, and looking up with an expression
of mingled pity and contempt for my credulity
enquired:</p>

<p>“Have you bought it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And paid for it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“May I ask how much?”</p>

<p>“Eight pounds.”</p>

<p>“I’ve bought tables like this for 35s.”</p>

<p>“Yes, some time ago.”</p>

<p>At this stage I fancy he thought he had put my
wind up, for he hedged by consoling me with the remark
“I saw a table like this fetch £11 10s. at a sale, and it had
worm holes too.”</p>

<p>Now take warning by this, and be sure you look out
for worm holes, but don’t be over anxious to buy more
than you can count, and if you should, then do not
pay much extra for them. Further, if you find these
pests getting busy in any of your furniture procure a
solution of corrosive sublimate of suitable strength and
saturate the parts affected, but as the chemical is a
deadly poison it is advisable to use a long handled brush
and not dab it on with the fingers.</p>

<p>I thank you for your sympathy, but am delighted
with my bargain, as the frame only needed the inside
soft wood to be replaced, and the table with its fine
Spanish wood top supported by well-fluted legs makes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
handsome, convenient, and useful centrepiece, for dining
purposes, and can be folded and put aside any time.</p>

<p>The tables shown on <a href="#PLATE_XIV">Plate <span class="smcap2">XIV</span></a> are very good
late eighteenth century examples. The one with drop
ends is mahogany, has a striking shell-like satinwood
ornamentation let in the middle, and inverted crocus
inlaid legs. The table with the folding legs was in a very
dirty condition when I purchased it, and was called
mahogany, and it was not until it was scraped that I
became aware it was made of birch, thickly veneered with
rosewood, and richly inlaid with satinwood. Oh, what a
prize surprise.</p>


<h3>BUREAUX AND CABINETS</h3>

<p>When China began to come in, I bought a fine
mahogany inlaid bureau and book-case in Cheshire at
about one-third of the cost of such a piece if you could
find it to-day. On examining the secret fittings I found
in pencil in quite old style handwriting on the bottom
of one of the drawers some lines headed, “Over the door
of a House of Pleasure at W/Church.” Unfortunately I
cannot give the context, as I fear it would not pass the
Press Censorship. When the bureau was cleaned and
re-polished I protected this precious indication that a
previous possessor was rather a sly old boy, and so I
retain this unique evidence of age. (<a href="#PLATE_XII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XII</span></a>)</p>

<p>When I commenced to write this book I found it
quite impossible to get along with a rather modern light
oak desk and I felt sure an old bureau would be of great
assistance in carrying inspirations relating to antiques;
and further that one must be obtained promptly. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
write a few hundred pages and have them typewritten
in triplicate it is advisable to have somewhere to keep
them, for it would be poor satisfaction to learn some
morning that a few score had served the useful purpose of
lighting the kitchen fire. The roomy drawers of a bureau
answer admirably and find accommodation for the
photographs as well. (<a href="#PLATE_XIII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XIII</span></a>)</p>

<p>My first enquiry was made of a dealer I will call A, who
informed me that bureaux were very scarce, but as he
attended most sales he would be on the look out and
do his best. I then went to another dealer and told
him of my intention, and asked him would he sell my
flat-top oak desk? Certainly he would, there was a
mahogany bureau to be sold at a sale the very next day
and he would buy it for me if I would give him a commission.
I said, “Very well I will slip over in the morning,
look at it and let you know.” I disturbed the auctioneer
feeding his poultry, and cajoled him to come to the house,
which I had found locked up. The bureau looked very
weary, but I knew it could soon be put right, so I posted
back to B and told him to buy it, using his own judgment
about the price. In the evening B called and said he had
bought the bureau, but the price was more than expected
as that chap A had run him up the last £2. Then it
dawned on me that I had been bidding against myself.</p>

<p>I may here mention I have never attended sales and
that this is the only antique illustrated in this volume
which has been bought at a sale on my behalf.</p>

<p>“There was an old woman who lived in a shoe” who
was greatly perplexed as to how to accommodate so many
children. I can sympathise with her, for having so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
pewter and being anxious to show it off I was much
worried “and didn’t know what to do.” I hunted about
and advertised for an oak cupboard with glass doors but
could find nothing suitable so I bought the chest shown.
Then I had the cupboard made from oak taken out of a
farm built in 1633 near St. Helens which had been
pulled down, while the top decoration is some of the
original wainscoting from Argoed Hall, Oswestry, which
I had by me, and it came in suitably for the frieze.
The top of the chest being in two pieces the cupboard
just fits on the hind portion while the front half lifts off,
and so I am enabled to stow a lot of extra pewter in the
chest. (<a href="#PLATE_XVII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XVII</span></a>)</p>

<p>Pewter plates and blue and white dishes needing
to be displayed, I had shelves fitted in my morning and
dining rooms. To provide for the china I purchased
the cabinet shown in <a href="#PLATE_XXXVIII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXVIII</span></a>, and in a short time
found four corner cupboards. It might take as many
years to find a lot to equal these, which are mahogany
made and all nicely inlaid. I bought them from the
same broker who astonished me by saying, “I am a
collector too&mdash;of sovereigns.”</p>


<h3>DATED FURNITURE</h3>

<p>Dated furniture is hard to find. I only have two
specimens, of which photographs are given. The initials
on the oak chest will be the initials of the first owner and
his wife, but whether this dating may be evidence of a
dower chest on their marriage, or whatever happened
to them in 1702, there is no question about the chest
being Queen Anne period. (<a href="#PLATE_VIII">Plate <span class="smcap2">VIII</span></a>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>As regards the salt box, the carved piece of oak which
bears the date 1659 has a much older appearance than the
rest of the box, although that is ancient timber. Probably
the seventeenth century article fell to pieces about a
hundred years ago, when the owners would have this one
put together. This shows how easy it may be for the
amateur to be misled as to the age of a faked article in
which an early date has been worked. I found it in a
shop on the North Pier at Blackpool, and was informed
it was bought at an old farm sale near Preston. (<a href="#PLATE_XI">Plate
<span class="smcap2">XI</span></a>)</p>


<h3>MAHOGANY CHESTS OF DRAWERS</h3>

<p>When I bought the dwarf chest shown on <a href="#PLATE_XVI">Plate <span class="smcap2">XVI</span></a>,
it was fitted with black wooden knobs which could not
have been on many years. On examination, marks were
sufficiently clear to enable me to judge to a nicety the
design of the brass plates the original handles would drop
on to; so I had five cut, and looked up some old handles
and fasteners. Then I was able to give the chest its
original appearance.</p>

<p>The large chest shown on <a href="#PLATE_XV">Plate <span class="smcap2">XV</span></a> really is a
beautiful piece of furniture, complete with its imposing
brass ring handles, original and perfect in every way just
as I bought it. The workmanship is of high class, and the
long secret drawer at the top has made a good hiding
place for a large number of amulets. The drawers are in
smooth running condition, and the oak linings are a fine
example of good work, while the mahogany cannot be
beaten. It came from the sign of “Uncle will oblige.”</p>

<p>The chest with bureau fitment on <a href="#PLATE_XIII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XIII</span></a> is, I
believe, a very rare specimen; it has one small and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
three large drawers, and is provided with a pull-out
drawer, fitted to answer the purpose of a bureau. I was
passing along a street in a busy town when I saw this
standing on the pavement. Out of curiosity I pulled
open the right hand top drawer, and immediately I
realised what happened, enquired the price. “Five
pounds; Mr. Smith is after it.” I paid the money without
hesitation, as the chest was in fine preservation. Mr.
Smith came after it about five minutes after it had been
fetched away in the cart which I had sent after it about
five minutes after I had walked back, it having taken me
about five minutes to accomplish this; and so Mr.
Smith was left “in the cart.” Moral&mdash;Go snap on a
bargain.</p>


<h3>TEA CADDY</h3>

<p>I must apologise for having omitted to introduce a
dear old friend earlier but I cannot let you complete this
course without making her acquaintance. Her well
preserved appearance coated with a rosewood overall,
the rings she carries at her sides and her dainty claw
feet must claim your notice. She has no hesitation in
allowing you at any time to admire her tight fitting combinations
which contain her black and green teas. I
have lifted her covering to reveal her velvet lining which
has stood the wear, without a tear, for more years than
you will credit her with. With what tender care she has
nurtured her Waterford Glass Sugar bowl now raised with
her fittings for your inspection. She has never lost sight
of her little Sheffield Plate spoon which has caddied
for her on every occasion when her numerous admirers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
needed the cup which soothes. Taking all her good
qualities into consideration we must pardon her desire
to have her photo taken too. (<a href="#PLATE_XIV">Plate <span class="smcap2">XIV</span></a>)</p>

<p>I appear to have touched on nearly all the Furniture
objects I have found it convenient to photograph indoors,
and as I am not stocktaking or compiling a catalogue
we will pass on to the second course.</p>

</div>


<p class="mt1">There is an old axiom that “a man is no good unless he
has a hobby,” but some of my friends say I have been no
use since I took up the collection of old pewter. Many
may wonder what induced a busy man to go to the
trouble of getting together a collection like that shown in
the photographs. It all arose through my rummaging in
a broker’s while waiting for a friend who was looking for
old books, and finding a mug which was dirty and black
with neglect but inscribed, “Canteen, 70th Regiment.”
My curiosity was aroused, and I became the owner. On
submitting this to a tinsmith it was pronounced to be old
pewter, and from the time it was polished, fifteen years
ago, I have been on the look out for more. The experience
I soon gained taught me that the collectors of old pewter
mainly belonged to that class with whom money is little
object, and that what they strived to obtain were very
old, unique pieces, communion vessels and historical
specimens, quite out of the reach of an ordinary householder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
This I recognised when visiting an exhibition
of Old Pewter at Clifford’s Inn Hall in 1908.</p>

<p>It must be patent to any reader that if those were the
only articles of interest that were worth securing for
exhibition purposes then the rest of the old stuff occasionally
turning up might as well go to the melting pot for
solder, the fate of so many tons in years gone by, and even
now men in ignorance of the antique value of old pewter
are daily melting specimens which would be fit to
decorate many a shelf. I have given much attention
to British pewter; the old associations appeal to my
imagination, and I have never been drawn to foreign
specimens.</p>

<p>If you suffer from a good memory you will recall that
Wolsey said to Cromwell, “Take an inventory of all I
possess.” Now if he had as many pieces in such variety
of any one line as I have of old pewter, then Wolsey was
giving Cromwell something to do, and as pewter was
knocking about in those days he may have had a fair
collection. I cannot pretend to describe many of my
pieces, but I present the reader with a selection of photographs,
and I hope these will, to a certain extent, speak
for themselves; anyway they give a good idea of the effect
a large collection of pewter has on the home, and on
the patience of those who attend to the dusting. Space
has not permitted me actually to show in my rooms
or have in the house more than 500 pieces, but I have,
as opportunity occurred, kept on improving the specimens
on view, and I could best do this by letting the stuff come
in whenever I heard of any likely lots, out of which
I selected what I fancied, getting rid of duplicates, pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
I did not care for, and sending modern and worthless
things to be melted.</p>

<p>So far back as 1908&mdash;since when my collection has
much improved&mdash;I had the pleasure of exchanging
photographs with a great connoisseur of old pewter, and
I was very gratified when he wrote to me as follows:</p>

<p>“There is so much that is worse than valueless in most
collections; so much unnecessary repetition, that large
collections become irritatingly monotonous. Although
your pieces are often repeated, the repetition represents
always an interesting variation; and this feature contributes
the element of evolution which is always interesting,
and without which no collection is complete or
satisfactory. I congratulate you, therefore, upon your
possessions, and think you have done remarkably well
during the short time. Could you let me see the two
‘salts’ marked on the photo?”</p>

<p>I sent the two “salts,” and he remarked, “The little
one is particularly interesting as it is a reversible one,
the only specimen I have seen.”</p>

<p>That special “salt” is the queer looking little thing
in the centre of the salt group, and I am giving it more
space than its size or appearance seem to warrant. It
was first caught sight of in a shop at Leeds, where a
broker had it filled with black varnish into which he was
dipping his brush, while he was giving an artistic touch-up
to some of his stock. The hunter spotted pewter, and
after some little chaff was told he could have it if he would
bring something that would do for holding the varnish;
this he bought at a shop not far off, and the change was
soon effected. It is a curious specimen, for whichever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
way it stands it will hold the salt, but in its present
position it will hold more than twice as much as when it
is placed the other way uppermost.</p>

<p>The results of my hunting and advertising not keeping
pace with my ambition for more, I secured the assistance
of a friend in Ireland, who proved to be a friend indeed.
He had a dog which was constantly jumping on the sofa
and chairs, so he called him Zacchæus because “he was
everlastingly telling him to come down.”</p>

<p>Have you heard of “Phil the Fluter”? I had not
until I heard our friend warble of the wonderful effect the
execution of that phenomenal flautist produced upon his
hearers, but I imagine the charm attained would be as
comparable with that of my Irish friend as modern is to
antique, while he has a tongue that would “wile a bird
off a tree.” Like Father O’Flynn he’d “a wonderful
way wid him, the young and ould sinners were wishful
to trade wid him.” I am not digressing but adorning
the tale to point the moral. With his cheery manner he
succeeded all the time to such an extent that I had to
wire him “Hold! enough.” Later when other collectors
sought my help to get them Irish measures he reported
“Too late, the Jews have been round and bought up the
lot. Why did you stop me just when I was getting my
hand in?” Explanatory of my reason for cancelling my
early instructions, let me give the following. I was
impatient to make a show, so told him to buy all the
pewter plates he came across. A few days after seventy
arrived in two filthy dirty sacks, the state of which
corresponded fairly well with the appearance of their
contents. He apologised later for the condition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
sacks which “he had borrowed from a place where they
had just skinned a dead horse.” Some of these plates
bore marks and a few others crests, but as the former
owners had a strange custom of polishing the backs with
sand, the marks were mostly rubbed off, and as they
never cleaned the fronts, my getting that consignment into
exhibition form required some trouble and expense,
but as the Tommy said after getting C.B. for being
absent without leave, “It was worth it.”</p>

<p>Referring to this consignment and to the sacks in
conversation later he expressed no wonder at my people
complaining when they and their contents were dumped
in the washhouse, as he thought they were a trifle high
after he found the boots of the hotel, where he had to
spend a night, had put them in his bedroom! Worse than
that, however, happened the following day. He had left
them at one end of the station platform with a porter, that
they might go in the guard’s van, while he went to another
part of the train and joined some friends. He had just
got seated when the porter who must have followed him
with the sacks on a truck, opened the door and enquired,
“Will your honour have these suit cases in the carriage
wid yer?”</p>

<p>The miscellaneous articles which arrived at frequent
intervals were wellnigh confusing, and it kept me busy
finding out what many of them were really for, but when
I found a pewter harp with a screw attached I was so
bewildered I wrote and asked him what on earth this harp
was out of, and he settled my mind by replying, “I
thought it had come down from heaven.”</p>

<p>On one occasion I saw quite a number of pieces in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
shop where I had now and then found an odd one, and
after making a few purchases enquired the reason for this
amazing influx, when I was informed, “You see it’s this
way; there’s a lady who’s got a husband who’s been
collecting pewter until she’s got fed up, so as he’s gone
off for a few days she asked me to call and take the lot
away, as she is not going to have any more of the dirty
stuff about.” Sequel&mdash;they lived happily ever after.</p>

<p>For a time I adopted the practice of getting men I
knew to save pewter for me, and, as my rambles permitted,
calling on them periodically. On one occasion I
was looking through the window of a marine store at
&mdash;&mdash; when I noticed something I was on the look-out
for. I entered, and enquired, “How about the pewter?”
The old fellow replied:</p>

<p>“Hello, you’ve come at last? It must be six months
since you asked me to save any bits that came in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” I said, “it’s better late than never,”
and paid him what he asked.</p>

<p>I had never visited the place before. Reader, I hope
you have never been the victim of mistaken identity.</p>

<p>You will recollect the story I told of my friend who
brought me my first eight-day clock. In talking over
reminiscences lately, I asked if he remembered assisting
me to get pewter. Instantly he replied, “Remember!
I shall remember it to my dying day. I was at Sneinton
(Nottingham), and I asked a marine store man had he any
pewter. He said, ‘Not here, but I have any amount at
my Radford place.’ Now Radford was out of my way,
but I thought I would do you a good turn, so I padded
there, about twenty minutes’ walk&mdash;it was warm. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
I got there, I was offered about half a hundredweight of
zinc that I should think had for a few years previously
been fastened on a pub counter. Of course I had to
walk back, and I never felt so hot in my life.”</p>


<h3>MARKS</h3>

<p>This is an all important subject to some collectors and
I feel I ought to treat it with a consideration bordering on
veneration, but anyone who has had to put up with the
queries I have been compelled to answer, which has
necessitated my fetching the step-ladder to bring down
plates from shelves in order that the marks may be
examined, would have the reverential esteem knocked
out of him. On one occasion a lady who had taken a
superficial look at my display remarked “What a
number of pieces you have. Do they all bear the
London mark?”</p>

<p>I was taken aback as I was unaware she was so well
up in the subject, but when she informed me she had
begun to collect and had already bought a 5s. half-pint
tankard with a cross and crown stamped on the bottom,
which the seller had assured her was the London mark,
then I understood.</p>

<p>When another visitor asked, “Is it all marked?” I
replied that I collected makes, not marks, and that was
why I had such a variety of pieces, and that many of my
most interesting specimens never bore any.</p>

<p>Those readers who want solid books of reference on
this point will find them among the works issued by
authors whose names are well known and to whose
remarkable patience in probing into the past I am under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a debt of gratitude. I must add that from information
received a work is coming out which will be quite the
last word on old pewter, its makers, and marks. I will
here repeat a statement which has been printed in
almost every book on old pewter since the flood of
1667&mdash;viz.: that the early touch plates of makers’ marks
were destroyed in the Great Fire of London.</p>

<p>With the aid of my old watchmaker’s magnifying
glass, 2¼ inches diameter, cased in horn and hinged on an
iron rivet to shut up and carry in the pocket, I have just
examined the fine quart tankard stamped “Js Dixon”
in three small panels. This was no doubt James Dixon’s
mark just after he lost his partner Smith, who had been
with him since 1809, and as he took his son into the
business in 1824, this mark I think, would only have
been used for about twelve months, and must be very
scarce. Underneath the maker’s name I see the first
Excise mark, “WR” surmounted with a small crown.
Next I find an imperfect impression which looks like
“NOXO,” but I can make no sense out of that; then I
discover a stamp “Crown V.R. 106,” and another with
a Crown between the letters “V.R.” also the figures “50,”
these all denoting that at least three inspectors have
passed this tankard as up to the standard at different
periods of its useful career.</p>

<p>Now I came to the most interesting part to my mind,
of the outward signs visible to the naked eye; under the
word “QUART,” which is boldly stamped, there are the
initials “T.B.” and a fine large crown with the date
“1823” all neatly engraved with some embellishment.
The initial letters will no doubt be those of the landlord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of a licensed house known as “The Crown,” and the
year that in which the tankard was made for him.</p>

<p>I have several other tankards bearing makers’ initials
and touch marks, and I know they were made prior to
1826, which I notice did not come into the Inspector’s
mutilating hand until Queen Victoria was on the throne.
I have just taken down two small measures of an uncommon
shape, a gill and half-gill. They have had a
small raised plate soldered on with raised lettering,
“Imperial G. Crown R. IV,” under. They were excised
once “W.R.,” and six times “V.R.”</p>

<p>I have gone to this trouble to make it clear that the
Excise marks are a lame guide to the age of early
pewter, as the Weights and Measures Act which compelled
inspection was passed only in 1826. These
Excise marks have been fair game for the antique dealers,
one of whom, when recommending me to buy some of his
tankards and measures, which bore a “Liver” bird as an
Excise stamp told me that Lady &mdash;&mdash; was collecting
only pewter which bore the Liverpool mark. He seemed
surprised at my ignorance when I told him this was the
first time I had heard Liverpool was celebrated for the
manufacture of pewter.</p>


<h3>PEWTER CANDLESTICKS</h3>

<p>Before going to bed I will just tell you how I got
these tall fellows shown on <a href="#PLATE_XX">Plate <span class="smcap2">XX</span></a>. They were in
a greengrocer’s shop window, so I thought I would
buy some apples. I came out with these 10½ inch candlesticks
as well. No, I did <em>not</em> steal them, and they were
not actually given away, but that is not what I wanted to
tell you. They have loose tops and in consequence are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
extra special. Be sure you blow out the light. Nearly
all pewter tops get melted through the candles being
left burning until they get down to the sockets.</p>

<p>Of the candlesticks in the group I wonder which you
will like the best. I prefer the 7 inch, as they are oblong
shape, base pillar and top; the bottoms have the original
wood filling and the very old baize to stand on. I found
these suddenly in the office of a gentleman who perchance
made a lot of money out of me; anyway, shortly after
this final transaction he retired from business, and built
and endowed a&mdash;cinema. One candlestick was broken
and the other needed repair, and as I could not clean
them in the usual way I sent them to a manufacturer
who made a good job and gave them a polish without
injury to the priceless bottoms. The 4½ inch pair were
kindly sent to me by a lady in Norway. I bought the
8 inch straight pillar pair from a Jew, who later wished
to buy them back as he had found a new customer who
would give 30s. for them. As I have given you these
sizes you can easily guess the heights of the remainder.</p>


<h3>CHURCH PEWTER</h3>

<p>Church pewter which has been associated with Church
worship now gets more worship than it did in its Church
days. Firstly from the dealers, who seem to be able
to get any money they like to ask from some collectors,
who in their turn worship their expensive idols mainly on
account of the satisfaction they experience in the knowledge
that no other collector can worship at the same
shrine. The flagon shown on <a href="#PLATE_XIX">Plate <span class="smcap2">XIX</span></a> originally
came from Bearley Church, near Stratford-on-Avon.
I was assured by the dealer that “Shakespeare
attended Bearley Church.”</p>

<p>“Did he read the lessons?”</p>

<p>“Of course, that’s why he went.”</p>

<p>After this I felt compelled to buy it.</p>

<p>I have some alms-dishes which may have done serious
duty and I have one which I feel sure has never been
inside any sacred building. I have also an old two-handled
cup and a pair of collecting plates from the old
Runcorn Baptist Chapel, which was erected soon after
1800 and closed about 1880; a small private set, paten
and chalice and an engraved Scotch chalice, and I will
embellish these notes by relating the extraordinary
circumstance which brought the latter into my fold at
a time when I was yearning for something sacramental.</p>

<p>I was in my office and had just put down a pewter
snuffers-tray when a traveller for a Scottish firm was
announced. As soon as the interview commenced he
opened his bag to get out his samples, when my eye
chanced to catch a glimpse of something almost hidden
by a sleeping garment and my instinct spotted pewter.
He told his tale and waited for an indication of the
impression he had created, which was conveyed to him
in this form.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, but was that a piece of old pewter I
caught sight of in your bag?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; are you interested in old pewter? I slept
the night in Warrington and I saw this in a shop as I was
going to the station; I think it is an old rose-bowl, and I
shall be pleased to give it to you if you will have it.”</p>

<p>Of course, I couldn’t think of such a thing, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
should be glad to exchange with him for a snuffers-tray
I had on my desk. He assured me that he would be
delighted, and as I always endeavour to give pleasure to
others I fetched the tray. That gentleman secured a
contract and a tray and left me with thanks and a seventeenth-century
Scotch chalice. You never know your
luck when collecting.</p>

<p>But for my awkward conscience I should include the
basin shown on <a href="#PLATE_VI">Plate <span class="smcap2">VI</span></a>, this being sold as “a vestry
piece.” It may have been used by the parson, or for
washing the Communion vessels, anyway I preferred to
believe the dealer, and gave it a conspicuous position,
which the ladies objected to, and I found it relegated to
the rear. On seeking an explanation, and calling it
“a vestry piece,” I retired hurt, so to speak, by the
remark “Vestry! Why my aunt had a thing like that,
in which she made us children wash our hands,” and then,
still so gently o’er me stealing, memory would bring back
the feeling of us youngsters having been caused to do the
same very necessary performance in a similar utensil,
with cold water from the pump at the old house at home
fifty to sixty years ago.</p>


<h3>FAKED PEWTER</h3>

<p>I had not been many years a collector before I found
spurious Communion cups and Communion sets were on
the market and I obtained some very enlightening information,
much of which I cannot publish. It was the
practice to blacken the new pieces with acid to give them
an appearance of age, and I heard of an instance relating
to hundredweights of faked pewter, but I am coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
straight to the point and the photographs on Plates
<a href="#PLATE_XXV"><span class="smcap2">XXV</span></a> and <a href="#PLATE_XXVI"><span class="smcap2">XXVI</span></a> will corroborate my statement. I was
further informed that they were making deep dishes
out of old bedpans, preserving the maker’s mark
on the bottom. I had had a bedpan hidden away in
the stable loft for some time, and I decided to prove
how far this information was correct. The pan had come
from Ireland with a box full of “gatherings,” and I
had almost decided to sell it to be melted.</p>

<p>I eventually wrote to a firm of pewter manufacturers
explaining the conversion I wished to have effected, and
they informed me they would do the job if I would say
whether I wanted a deep dish or a shallow one and what
width of rim I desired. In about three weeks after I had
sent them the bedpan I received the fine deep (alms) dish
bearing the maker’s name and mark&mdash;Joseph Austen&mdash;well
preserved, proving the article was made in Cork over
100 years ago. It looks very well indeed and I have never
had its virtue questioned; in fact when I have told
visitors they have been greatly astonished, while a few
have been hard to convince.</p>

<p>Now you understand my remark that I had one “alms
dish” that had never been inside a sacred edifice.</p>

<h3>PLATES AND DISHES</h3>

<p>These under the eye of the camera are more or less
alike, especially more&mdash;then let it suffice the reader to
learn that I have forty small and thirty large of various
sizes displayed wherever a likely space is available without
giving a too crowded appearance. They nearly all bear
makers’ marks or owners’ crests or initials, or evidence that
they have been put to good use at some time or other.
I have been told that when these big chaps were in vogue
the various conglomerations forming the meal were
heaped together and formed a goodly pile, so there is no
doubt of the authenticity of the story of the Scottish
farmer with a prodigious appetite at a Rent Dinner
who when they wanted to take away his plate said
“Bide awee for I hae just found a doo (pigeon) in the
reddin o’ ma plate.”</p>

<p>As regards the rims, while I know some enthusiastic
collectors could talk for a week on this feature,
which to the uneducated suggests distinction without a
difference, I will not labour the point.</p>

<p>I saw some very bright 9 inch plates in London
recently with ornamental rims, and out of curiosity
enquired the price. I was told 25s. each, but the information
that they were Dutch was not vouchsafed.</p>

<p>Probably my “pride of the paddock” plate is one on
<a href="#PLATE_XIX">Plate <span class="smcap2">XIX</span></a> (facing p. 43). It has a raised bead running
round the centre of the rim, is thought to be early
eighteenth century, and was made by Allen Bright,
who has since retired from business. Judging by its
shape it should pass muster as a genuine alms dish;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
though it may have been constructed to hold pennies in
the kirk, I think it just as likely it held puddings in the
kitchen&mdash;a thought inspired by the old knife-cuts on the
bottom.</p>

<p>I have referred to the Irish plates being scoured
on the back, and wiped on the front. Apropos of this
remark I have a set of eight with the crest of a sea-horse
on the rim; the marks are all obliterated, with the exception
of the word “Jonas,” and by the lettering I was
able to identify it as made by Jonas Durand about 1660.
I also have three plates with the crest which represents
the red hand of Ulster, and I believe they would originally
be the property of an old Derbyshire family that has an
estate in Ireland.</p>

<p>I have one very rare plate inasmuch as it bears on its
surface ten rows of tap marks made with a round-headed
hammer. The number in each circle lessens until they
get down to seven, which surround the centre tap. This
plate bears the initials and touch impression of the maker,
which are undecipherable, but that does not worry me.
I would far rather have the uncommon surface and
indistinct marks than plain marks and a smooth surface.
The strange thing is that if anyone wants a plate to,
perhaps, stand a pot on, and there is no pottery one handy,
or the artistic eye thinks a certain pot or flower would go
better with a pewter than with a coloured pottery plate,
they invariably lift this one off the dresser shelf, when
any of the others would do equally well. This must stop,
as I find the treatment does not improve its peculiar
appearance.</p>

<p>On the first shelf of the oak dresser (<a href="#PLATE_VI">Plate <span class="smcap2">VI</span></a>) there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
are four Scotch plates made by William Hunter, of
Edinburgh, 1749-1773. The fronts must always have
been well polished, for they shine like silver now. The
backs have been kept clean, though not scoured, as
the maker’s name and touchmarks are quite distinct.
One pair were called “meatplates” and the other
“pudding” or “porridge plates.” The latter are
deep and would pass for collecting-plates among church
pewter in some hands. My obtaining possession of these
from the shelves of a farm kitchen in Scotland is an
illustration of the proverb that kissing goes by favour.
I wish I could obtain more in the same very agreeable
manner.</p>

<p>As evidence of the age of the plates and dishes I give
the following list of makers’ names, and the approximate
dates when they were making these things hum.
For most of my records I have searched my books of
reference, and when these have failed me I have appealed
to Mr. H. H. Cotterell, a great authority on marks,
who has very kindly furnished me with the information
required whenever possible.</p>

<p>I must mention a pair of very rare plates of special
shape with tooled borders. Two holes are drilled in each,
and it is probably due to the fact that some vandal has
scratched the name “Lizzie” on them that they have not
been put to the use for which they were intended, namely,
to embellish the drop handles of an old-time coffin.
When an obliging broker told me he had a couple of
plates he had saved for me, and then produced these
ghastly things, I was rendered mute.</p>

<p>Well she may with whisky at half a guinea a bottle!</p>

<p>When we were in Barmouth we stayed at the Cors-y-gedll
Hotel, and when I asked the landlord, who up to that
point had been the personification of geniality, “What
is the meaning of Cors-y-gedll?” he blurted out,
“Nobody knows; everybody asks me that question,”
and left me abruptly. I was not a collector of old
pewter in those days, but I can now fully appreciate the
cause of his irritability, for the number of times I have
been asked, “What is the meaning of ‘Tappit Hens’?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>”
leaves me tired. I once suggested that the name may
have originated because they tappited to see if it was
empty or not, only to be further puzzled by the query
“But why hen?” and I could only suggest that “It
cackled whenever it laid an egg,” which was condemned
as an inane joke, which if I had any conceit of myself as a
humorist I should never repeat.</p>

<p>Having read so much about Tappit Hens, I have
known all about the history a long time ago, and I have
forgotten most of it. The name for a Scottish pint
measure of a certain shape was “Tappit Hen,” which
held two quarts (Imperial). A “Chopin” held a quart
and a “Mutchkin” an Imperial pint. My photograph
shows a pair of Tappit Hens and a Chopin.</p>

<p>After Tappit Hens came the lidded whisky stoups
which were in use in Scotland from 1826 to about 1870,
when an Act was passed to do away with profiteering by
short measure, and so the use of lids was prohibited.</p>

<p>As inspired individuals began to buy up the original
Tappit Hens the supply gave out, so the dealers elevated
the whisky stoups to the designation of the former. I do
not exaggerate, for I have seen Tappit Hens advertised,
and had them sent on approval, only to find the much less
valued stoup, or pot-bellied measures as they were often
called. Now I suppose they are getting done up, and
that any old thing with a lid on is a Tappit Hen. Anyway,
I was told by a gentleman, whose knowledge and
experience of his profession are much greater than they
can be of Scottish pewter, that he had just bought a
French Tappit Hen!</p>

<p>In all my travels I have only been offered the genuine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
article once, and that was in Glasgow some years back,
and as I already had two of the same size I did not buy,
although it would have been a good investment at the
price at which I could then have purchased it. The
three imposing Tappit Hen shaped measures I have bear
on the lids the imprints of the initials of a fine family,
whose old grey stone hall still stands in its lonely but
grand surroundings on the Pentland Hills, of which I am
constantly reminded by the kindness of a descendant,
who placed these treasures in my hands.</p>

<p>I am not a statistician, but I dare hazard an opinion
that there are ten or may be twenty times more “Tappit
Hens” in existence to-day than ever were made.</p>

<p>It is now time I tapped Burns again:</p>

<h3>BRITANNIA METAL</h3>

<p>This name puts me on my mettle, and as the uncertainty
of what is the difference between pewter and
Britannia metal has not to my knowledge been clearly
explained I intend to deal with this question somewhat
didactically.</p>

<p>I was so struck with the effect of turning my 70th
Regiment pint pot from a dirty disused mug into a
pleasurable thing that I visited all likely shops for some
few miles round and bought up everything I thought and
was told was old pewter, and I soon had more than
would fill a corner cupboard, which I had lined with
blue velvet to show it off. Then I bought “Marks on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Old Pewter,” by W. Redman, which was the only book
bearing on the subject I could hear of, and in it I
read:</p>

<div class="bq">

<p>“The manufacture of goods in Britannia (white metal)
was an important 18th century addition to the Sheffield
industries. Whether James Dixon or James Vickers
commenced first to make this kind of ware we are not able
to say. It is said that James Vickers bought for five
shillings from a sick man whom he happened to be
visiting a recipe for making white metal. The experiment
turned out a great success, and for years both these firms
were kept busy making all kinds of articles of what was
called Britannia metal. Now these old articles are often
called pewter, which is a mistake; neither of these firms
made any pewter ware. Alloy: 80 per cent. tin, 10 per
cent. antimony, and a little copper.”</p></div>

<p>This was rather a blow, as some of my purchases were
stamped “Britannia Metal” and a few others “B.M.E.P.,”
although the electro-plate was mostly worn off, giving the
things a pewter-like look. Next I obtained a short history
of the firm of James Dixon and Sons, and found they did
make pewter in their early days. I also learned from a
history of Sheffield in the 18th Century that Vickers
started making money and Britannia metal at the end
of that period, so this stuff seemed ancient enough.</p>

<p>I now had the pleasure of obtaining “Old Pewter,”
by Malcolm Bell, and found among the illustrations
articles of which I had duplicates, one of which was a
pepper-pot, and this reminds me that when I went in for
this and inquired the price, and was told fourpence, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
repeated the word “fourpence!” which immediately
drew the rejoinder “Yes, fourpence, it’s half full of
pepper.” From the trouble I had in getting out that
solid pepper, I rather think the pewter must have been
built round it.</p>

<p>I opened a correspondence with Mr. Bell, and he most
courteously and kindly gave me every assistance. In one
of his letters he wrote: “I must confess that for my
own part I could not pretend to draw any hard and fast
line between pewter and Britannia metal, for though
one can tell the difference between the extreme types by
the eye the varieties merge so gradually into each other
that the boundary is indefinable. In fact, hard metal
pewter with 96 parts tin, 8 of antimony, and 2 of copper
is practically identical with the Britannia metal containing
92 parts of tin, 8 of antimony, and 2 of copper,” which
was what I expected. Consequently I have among my
lot many pieces which may have been sold as Britannia
metal in the old days, but I would defy anyone to pick
them out and prove them not to be pewter.</p>

<p>I asked Mr. Redman to come over and see me, and
he readily did so. After he had gone, and from remarks
he had made, I gathered he had been more impressed by
the kindness of my partner than with the quality of some
of my pewter. The result of this interview was that I
never refused anything in the pewter line of mature age,
and came to the conclusion that the difference in the
names was a clever move of cute business men to enable
them to charge something extra for their wares which
were made of somewhat harder metal than was being
generally used at the time. I have frequently come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
across early plates and tankards that differed materially
in their hardness.</p>


<h3>MISCELLANEOUS PIECES</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Pap-Boat.</span> On shelf 3, <a href="#PLATE_XXI">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXI</span></a> (facing p. 47), I
show a specimen of rarity. Pap-boats would be as
common as babies at one time. This one was bought
at Lytham, and was introduced to me as a pig feeder.
It is 4½ inches long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Castor-oil spoons.</span> What a fuss they made about
taking a dose of castor oil, or had they not conceived
the idea of disguising it between other liquids? The
manipulation of such a spoon was a tricky job, for after
getting it into the mouth a twist would be needed to
bring the lid on to the tongue, the lid would partly
drop open and the castor-oil would then flow gently down
the patient’s throat, provided of course there was no
resistance. This forcible feeding was of everyday
occurrence. The larger of the spoons is about seventy
years old, and the smaller about ninety years.</p>

<p>There are eighty-five specimens on <a href="#PLATE_XXI">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXI</span></a>, and
I believe that the reader, with the aid of a magnifying
glass, will be able to form a very good idea of each piece.
The photographing of the groups generally entailed
quite a lot of work, and some anxiety, for as I do not
develop myself, or, rather, as I do not do my own developing,
I had put all the things back in their places
before I knew if the negatives were right. Fortunately it
turned out all the exposures had been correctly timed,
which was more than I anticipated with the varying and
often poor December light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The “Odamifino”</span> (<a href="#PLATE_XXVI">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXVI</span></a>, facing p. 74.).</h3>

<p>This was picked up quite recently by a keen collector
of rags and bones and other relics whose glory has
departed. It was snapped out of his day’s doings by a
flourishing dealer in anything that blew into his yard,
and it was only by my going over the top of about
10,000 rabbit skins, the age of which could be more
accurately guessed by their odour than by their sealskin-like
appearance, that I caught sight of it. Then
ensued a discussion as to the part this pewter had
played in the past. The R and B collector called it a
“Funniosity,” the skin specialist diagnosed it as a
“Cream jug,” while a third gentleman (who dare not
take on any other job than spirit testing while he is
drawing out-of-work pay) said without hesitation, but
not very distinctly, “Odamifino,” with a pronounced
emphasis on the second syllable. When I suggested it
might be a barber’s shaving-pot I was immediately ruled
out of that court, as “Barbers never used anything
made of pewter.”</p>

<p>Now if any collector can inform me when “Odamifinos”
were in vogue, and why they came into existence,
I shall be obliged, and in the meantime I will consider the
cleaning, for is not cleanliness akin to collectingness?
At present it has hardly an appearance suitable to my
cabinet of rarities, while its high-sounding designation
suggests that as its proper environment, and yet I have
in mind the quip of that inveterate humorist Froude,
“A thing of beauty is a joy for ever,” muttered at the
Annual Meeting of the Peace Congress, when Carlyle
chipped in with a chuckle, “Rough hew them as we will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>”
to be capped by that infernal joker Dante with the
remark, “You cannot paint the lily whiter.” At this
point Mr. Chairman Darwin brought back the members
to their customary somnolence with the admonition:
“Come, gentlemen, please, don’t ape the silly goat. The
next subject for consideration is ‘Shaving&mdash;should each
customer have fresh water?’”</p>


<h3>CLEANING</h3>

<p>This was a great source of trouble to me and to those
associated with my home life, and it was not until I had
strained their patience almost to the separation point
that I was informed: “You really must make some
arrangement for getting the pewter cleaned elsewhere, as
the maids have given warning they cannot put up with
the master messing up the kitchen any longer. Half the
saucepans are ruined, as of course they could not be used
after having that filthy stuff in them.”</p>

<p>I started boiling corroded pieces and letting them
soak in washing soda all night, but found this made no
impression on those which had been most neglected, while
some came bright after a good scouring with hot water
and Brookes’s soap, being later polished with methylated
spirit and plate powder. I may here advise the reader
that the latter treatment is all I now find necessary to
furbish up my stock and keep it presentable.</p>

<p>I will not dwell further on my early difficulties, but
relate how they were overcome. At the time I was almost
overwhelmed with putrid plates, dishes, and other
things I had received Mr. Redman came to my rescue
with the following recipe:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“2 oz. rock lime, 2 oz. caustic soda, 6 oz. common
salt, 8 oz. common soda, dissolve in 3 quarts of water in a
saucepan on the fire. When dissolved pour into a bowl,
and when cold add eight quarts of cold water. Steep
as long as necessary as much pewter as the liquid will
cover, and the bath can be used until the liquor has lost
its nature.”</p>

<p>I had a mixture made in a bath and let the things lie
in this until the corrosion was easily wiped off, and I
entrusted this job to a man who had been used to cleaning
machinery and whose practical knowledge and serviceable
hands made him far more competent than his employer.
I never had the surface of the pewter injured
in any way with the strong solution, and so long as the
rubbing with the coarse flannel and Brookes’s soap was
done the way of the grain&mdash;that is, circular or round and
round&mdash;no scratching was apparent. When I say I have
dealt with no fewer than 1,450 pieces the reader may
gather that the trouble and expense has not been trifling.</p>

<p>I hope this information in regard to cleaning may be of
value to many amateurs, to whom I wish good luck.</p>

<p>In case some curious minds may wonder how I account
for the difference between the total given and the 500
pieces I stated I now have I do not mind disclosing that
I sent a lot of it to a friend at New York who was anxious
to exhibit his old family plate, and I learnt when he was
last over that as the brightness I had been at such pains
to secure militated, in his opinion, against the appearance
of antiquity he had abstained from further cleaning,
and that the pewter was now looking quite old.</p>

<p>I believe I must have earned that friend’s undying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
gratitude, for did I not provide him with his great-great-grandfather’s
clock, and further spared him and
shipped out an early dated Broadwood grand piano,
which I had previously converted into a dressing-table,
and which he has since discovered is the identical
instrument that his great-great-grandmother used for the
five-finger exercise?</p>


<h3>THE TINSMITH</h3>

<p>I have mentioned that on some occasions I found it
necessary to send pewter to the manufacturers, but I
have scores of pieces which only required slight repairs&mdash;soldering,
straightening and reshaping&mdash;such as an accomplished
tinsmith could manage. Fortunately I found
the man of the hour, day, month, and year, and not far off,
and I cannot say how much time I spent in his workshop.
He was always very busy, and if I sent him anything to do
I never knew when I should see it again, so I had to resort
to taking it myself and waiting until it was finished,
otherwise it would be half done and then laid aside while
he went out to pick a lock, or put down while he mended
a kettle or something that was most urgently required.
Really the way he handled my pewter was terribly
fascinating, making pieces so hot at times and putting
them so close to his fire that I positively trembled for fear
they would be ruined altogether, but he never made a
mistake.</p>

<p>His favourite expression was, “You understand me,”
so the reader will appreciate that these three words kept
coming into his conversation in the most unexpected
places. “It was a good job&mdash;you understand me&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
church was burnt out. I got all the organ pipes; I’m
using some of them in this solder&mdash;you understand me&mdash;about
18 cwt. of them altogether.”</p>

<p>I took him a big jug to have the handle soldered not
long ago. I saw him start it and said I would call on my
way back from the bank. I did so and found the job
only partly done. By way of explanation he said:</p>

<p>“Mr. A. has been in about a freeze&mdash;you understand
me.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid I don’t. What is a freeze?”</p>

<p>“A refrigerator for milk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, will you be much longer?”</p>

<p>In the course of my many entertaining interviews I
learnt that he first went into a shop when he was aged 8,
in the year 1847. Tinsmiths then used to fix all gaspipes,
and I have found out since that Westminster Bridge was
first illuminated with gas in 1813. But to go back to my
confrère. He did not stop in the shop long, as he was sent
to school for about twelve months. The school was in a
cellar, with forms round, on which there was always a
birch-rod handy, and as the schoolmaster had been a
soldier he knew how to use it, and my friend added: “You
understand me&mdash;there were no inspectors in those days.”</p>

<p>It was on the floor of this workshop that I literally
“picked up” the James Dixon quart tankard which I
described under <i>Marks</i>. It lay amongst other scrap
pewter in a dark corner, ready for going into the melting-pot,
when I kicked against it and so prolonged its life.
It is now 96.</p>

<p>I am afraid my tinsmith is no respecter of old age, for
he is at the time I write this only eighty, and when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
congratulated him upon his steady hand and wonderful
eyesight he smiled and said: “My mother was ninety-one,
and she didn’t know what spectacles meant.”</p>

<p>More power to his elbow.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Conclusion</span></h3>

<p>I have little more to say on the subject of old
pewter generally, as the Tavern Measures are given
an article on their own. Of course, I have left the
photographs to do most of the talking, and I hope they
have risen equal to the occasion. Next to the fascination
of collecting comes the pleasure of exhibiting to an
appreciative audience, and this brings to mind a delightful
evening when a young witty Canadian went through my
show, and at the conclusion, in the naïvest manner
possible, said: “I have asked you a great many
questions, sir, but as I am undecided in my mind I thought
before I left I had better enquire, ‘does the pewter go
with your daughter?’”</p>


<h3>THE PEWTER POT</h3>

<p>Half a century ago Winchester Cathedral in the winter
was decidedly cold, and on occasions some of those small
choir boys, who found little warmth and comfort from
their white linen surplices, now and then collapsed during
the services. Candles may have answered the purpose of
providing all the illumination required, but they were
hardly a flaming success for heating purposes. In the
records of the deliberation of the Dean and Chapter at
that time there would be a resolution to pay Mr. Edward
Sheppard, of the Bishop’s Palace, a certain sum to provide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
each of the youthful songsters entrusted to his care with
a pot of porter each day with their dinners. Which
denotes there was no Pussyfoot in that Chapter. Mr.
Sheppard, whose name I use with all respect, was most
particular as to his pupils’ cleanliness, and every morning
held a hand and neck inspection in the long hall by the
entrance door. To illustrate that he had a mind for the
internal as well as the external frames which filed past
him he once a week, being provided with a bowl of
brimstone and treacle, administered a tablespoonful to
each boy. If Mr. Sheppard had given the same scrutiny
to the big can in which the porter was drawn from the
barrel there would have been no heel taps in our pewter
pots, but as the can was rarely washed out, and the porter
left from one day was frothed up when being filled the
next, the result, so far as benefit to the boys was concerned,
must have been flat, stale, and unprofitable.</p>

<p>No writer refers oftener to the pewter pot than does
Charles Dickens, and he might have said of me, as he
did of Master Micawber, “He was brought up to the
Church.”</p>

<p>In the book of the chronicles of Pickwick the reader
can easily find the text suitable for my discourse. That
great and good man with his host of friends used the
pewter pot with such effect that it would be a national
scandal to allow it to be relegated to the lumber shop.
Old Pickwick and old pewter are synonymous, and so let
us keep his memory alive by preserving the main medium
of his hospitable and generous nature. Time is changing
everything so ruthlessly that unless some of us have a
care the passing of the pewter pot will become an absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
fact. To guard against such a calamity, and to preserve
models of a commodity which played so important a part
in the episodes that made life in England all the brighter
for its presence in past centuries, I have gathered together
a representative array of old pewter pots, many bearing
quaint inscriptions, which, if they could speak for themselves,
would enable me to treat you to a chapter replete
with true stories of adventure, love, crime, deeds of chivalry,
and scenes of woe which no imagination could evolve.</p>

<p>What of the “70th Regiment” cup? What stirring
episodes has that been through?&mdash;among others, probably
the Afghan War of 1840. I do know that the “Shipwrights’
Arms’, Limehouse Hole,” pint took part in, and
survived, the Indian Mutiny bivouacs and battlefields, as
it was given by the then landlord to a soldier just before
leaving home. I specially prize this; it has written
on the front before the address the name, “D. Saul,”
alongside which is the toper’s big initial, “K,” and the
number of his peg or hook on which it hung, “55,” on the
bottom. This number would be seen when looked up at
from the floor.</p>

<p>If Pickwick has us in hand, we shun the battle and
resort to the bottle, so let us look in at the “Windmill,
Dartford,” and see what manner of men were there.
Surely not smugglers on the banks of the Thames? Of
about the same period, what was the “Wellington,
Shepherd’s Bush,” like? Rather a swagger inn, probably,
judging by the beaded pattern of the mug, which was
supplied or made by “W. R. Loftus, 146, Oxford Street,”
who has been, and will be, a long time dead. At the
“Feathers” at Chiswick, and “Hope,” Islington, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
must have had quite high-class callers, or why the lip on
the tankards unless it were to pour the contents into
beakers? The customers at all inns were so diversified
in character that I see no reason why the same measure
should not have done for the post-boy on his frequent
calls, for the parish priest on duty bent, or later by the
highwayman in a hurry, if they held it in the left hand
and turned the lip of the pot skywards.</p>

<p>From London to the “Blackburn Arms,” Hale,
situated on the Mersey, an old-time village, and home of
the Ireland Blackburne family, was a long journey by
road in those days, and the pewter pot would be in
great request. I warrant this particular one was handed
back many a time with a determination to “Have
another, and dom the expense.”</p>

<p>When I came across the pint inscribed “Post Office
Hotel, Church Street, Soho,” I wrote to a Fleet Street
friend asking him to find out a likely date for it, and after
making enquiries he reported he could find neither the
hotel nor Church Street, and that the oldest man he had
seen in Soho (a sexton, I think) could tell him nothing
about either. The same friend was here one night, and I
left him looking at these pewter pots. I heard a Fleet
Street exclamation of surprise, and when I enquired the
reason he held up the “Baker’s Arms’, Waltham Abbey,”
pint, saying, “Why, I was born close to the Baker’s
Arms.”</p>

<p>The “Post Office Hotel” brings the post-boy of old to
my mind, and I turn to the oldest book I possess, given
to me by my father, in which he wrote my name in 1861.
“The Sporting Scrap Book,” by Henry Alken, containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
fifty plates, designed and engraved by himself,
published by Thomas McLean, 26, Haymarket, 1824.
I have always treasured this book, and the coloured prints
are as good to-day as ever. I was wondering how often
the pewter pot appeared in Alken’s drawings, and I find
twice. The first is entitled “The Post-Boy,” who with a
pair of harnessed horses has just called for drinks for
himself and his horses, and no sooner has he got his than
he has the pot to his lips. The shape is similar to the
“Post Office Hotel” pint, but probably the “Post-Boy”
needed a quart, for the pewter pot is as tall as his pot
hat. In the second picture Alken shows a pewter pot with
almost as much “frill” on the top as there is round the
cap of the woman who holds it, and this one is also the
same shape, which confirms my impression that the “Post
Office Hotel” pint pot is about 100 years old.</p>

<p>I now turn my attention from the handy pints to the
capacious quart pots, just the things to wash down a
breakfast with; pause and conjecture what “lovely”
thirsts they must have had! It was quite the custom
to put the landlord’s monogram on the front, and the
name of the tavern on the bottom of the mugs; there
again is a theme for reflection. As a reason, I think
we may assume there were kleptomaniacs, souvenir
hunters, and sneak thieves in the far gone times, just as
there are to-day, and by marking in this way it would
limit the loss to the latter class, who would sell the things
for old metal. These big mugs would well set off a table
on which were pewter plates anything from nine to twenty
inches in diameter. Although I have studied all the books
written on old pewter, I have failed to find that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
always a case of “One man, one quart,” and am forced
to the conclusion that there may have been odd occasions
when more than one shared.</p>

<p>To get back to the pots illustrated, does any living man
know where the “Baptist Head,” High Holborn, stood?
It is perhaps typical of the country that the largest and
heaviest quart comes from Ireland, and from the battered
condition it was in when I got it, I surmised it had often
been used to add weight to an argument.</p>

<p>My eye now wanders to the fine old loving cup made
by John Edwards about 1750. This has a glass bottom
to prove to all users how clear were its contents, and I
wonder to what extent it has been used at family gatherings
for weddings, christenings, and buryings, and the
very important part it has played in making them all
enjoyable. Glance at that copious lidded jug, and mulled
ale at once suggests itself; can you not hear the horn
that gives warning of the stage coach, the bustle at the
“Queen’s Hotel” (called after Mary, Elizabeth, or
Anne, probably), or imagine the anxiety of the passengers
to test the brew, and how quickly the jug would be
emptied on a cold journey, while on warmer days the
flat-bottomed jug, full to the brim with foaming beer,
would be equally welcome? Some of the pots are fitted
with a strainer at the lip, and this would be most useful in
the period of poor lighting and typical practical joking
by keeping hops, flies, wasps, cockroaches, or perhaps an
odd mouse, out of the mouth of the customer using the
mug. It would also be requisite to use the funnel when
filling passengers’ flasks, most travellers were no doubt
provided with the latter of no mean size. The funnel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
shown is dated 1698, while a particular flask I illustrate
is a fine specimen; probably its original owner was a man
of grit, for roughly engraved on one end is “PRO DAOS
ET REGE,” a fitting toast when the custom was “The
Passing of the Pewter Pot.”</p>

<p>You will, I hope, be interested in a study of the
variety of shapes and handles on the photographs, but
you need to handle these old things to realise their
fascination; even if they bear no inscription or maker’s
mark, some of the early Excise marks, “G.R.” or “W.R.”
with various town crests, are worth looking at. Could
you examine the bottoms you would find red cut glass,
plain glass (Waterford possibly), wood and pewter,
double and single pewter bottoms, some with holes in their
bottoms through age and ill usage, while one has no bottom
at all, so you can’t knock the bottoms out of that. One of
the quart measures bears the initials and touch mark of
George Bagshaw, who was enrolled on the list of the
Freemen of the Pewterers Company in 1826; it is boldly
stamped with a crown, and the words “Imperial
Standard” with a small stamp “Crown W.R.” with
“W.W.” under. I am not sure what “W.W.” stands
for, but believe it will be the initials of the Excise
Inspector, and that this measure would be the Imperial
standard whereby the quart measures in a certain locality
were tested. The list of inscriptions given should not
fail to entertain; some are quaint and there may be one or
two that a reader will recall, but I imagine that most of the
addresses have ceased to exist.</p>

<p>This remark does not apply to the Old Whyte Harte
Hotel at Wisbeach (now spelt Wisbech), for that is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
present day Izaac Walton Association House. My set
of measures was made by Grimes, of London, for J. Hill,
the landlord in 1880.</p>

<p>The collection continues to increase, and I have
recently acquired a quart, mark “S.C.” inscribed
“Longden White, Ewell, 1820.” Another, which belonged
to W. James, Welney, marked four lions&mdash;a
lipped quart by Geradin &amp; Watson, stamped “G.R.”
1826, and lastly a quart pot-bellied measure by W.
Nettleford, early 19th century, being the only measure
of this shape which I have seen fitted with a lip. I
must now end this potty discourse, and on pondering
for a fitting quotation wherewith to conclude, I can think
of none more suitable than one which I trow good King
Hal is not likely to have used when ruminating on his
bunch of wives&mdash;“Let ’em all come.”</p>


<h3>THE MYSTERY PIECE (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXVII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXVII</span></a>, facing p. 75).</h3>

<p>I have given this title to the photograph I recently
had taken for various reasons which I will now particularise.
Most books contain a mystery of some kind and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
creation in many instances must cause the author much
anxious thought, but in my case the mystery is real up to
the time of writing; possibly soon after this appears in
print the mystery will be explained by some kind correspondent
who possesses a similar piece. In the first place,
I know not its proper name, so must call it for the time
being “the piece.” Where I obtained it will remain a
mystery to the reader, but how I happened to become its
possessor I will readily relate, and in doing so I confirm
my previous statement that you never know your luck
when collecting.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1919 business called me to London
on several occasions, and as many readers will have had
unpleasant experiences of the hotel accommodation there
at that time they will not be surprised to hear that I made
arrangements with friends who live in a fine old town
umpteen miles from the City to take me in. On a visit
in June I was walking to the station to catch the morning
train to take me to London when I passed a broker’s
shop and of course stopped. Among a lot of furniture
and odds and ends I noticed “the piece,” and I thought
at first it was a brass water bottle from India, but on
further consideration I felt sure it was pewter, so I
essayed to walk in, but locks, bolts and bars defied
resistance, while no one took heed of the noise I was
making. In the end I had to rush for the train. Business
over I returned and was met at the station by a lady friend.
I am afraid I hurried her along to the shop where I saw
“the piece” still perched. I tried the door again, but
it was still fastened, so I started knocking. My friend
then informed me it was no use as it was the half holiday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
but I was determined to get in if I rattled all night. At
length I was admitted, found “the piece” was real old
pewter, was informed they had had it a fortnight, and
that it was a <span class="smcap">Rose Vase</span>, but they didn’t know where it
came from. There are antique shops in that town, and this
was just the sort of thing they could have done with, so
my picking it up when on a flying visit was most
fortunate.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Plate XXVII.</span></p></div>
</div></div>

<p>On returning to my real home “the piece” was much
admired for its antique appearance and I was told I
should spoil it if I had anything done to it, so I had it
photographed in the state I found it. It bore no maker’s
marks and the shape was quite unknown to me, so I
wrote to three pewter connoisseurs sending them each a
photograph giving dimensions and weight and asking
them to give me its name and age. These are the opinions
I received:</p>

<div class="bq">
<p class="uni">No. 1:</p>

<p>“Your <span class="smcap">Vessel</span> seems to be a <span class="smcap">Vase</span> and latish. I
have never seen one like it.” And later he kindly
wrote: “The more I think of your pewter <span class="smcap">Jar</span> the more
convinced I am that it dates about 1750.”</p>


<p class="uni">No. 2 said:</p>

<p>“I thank you for the photograph of the interesting
<span class="smcap">Vase</span> or <span class="smcap">Bottle</span>, for those are the only possible names
one can give to the piece.”</p>

<p class="uni">No. 3. wrote:</p>

<p>“I have seen two or three of the pieces your photograph
shows but have never found out their purpose. I
have heard them described as 1. <span class="smcap">Lavers</span> for the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in Baptism. 2. <span class="smcap">Water Bottle</span> used in Tavern
parlours, and I think the latter is more probable.”</p>
</div>

<p>So you see I had then six names for it, and lately when
my Irish friend was here I asked him his opinion and he
said, “It reminds me of ‘Rebecca at the Well.’” This
set me longing to see what it looked like when Rebecca
used it, so I got a painter to remove the corrosion with
caustic and lime, as I had no bath mixture on tap, then
I took it to my tinsmith and spent some time quaking&mdash;you
understand me&mdash;for fear he should hole it or do
something awful, but he straightened it, tapped out the
dinges, and soon got it into its original shape. Strange
to say it is the only piece of pewter in my collection which
I prefer to see looking dull, the reason why is another
mystery, but I have stopped having it polished up
brightly like the rest. I really believe it is the oldest
specimen in my collection, certainly it is the most antique
in shape. It is nine inches high and its weight (2½ lbs.)
denotes it was made when thick metal was worked with,
and that is a sure sign of old times. It will not go with
any pewter I possess, it makes it all appear comparatively
modern, and so we have to allot it a position by itself on
an old oak chest, and here I will leave “The Mystery
Piece,” with this poser&mdash;is it early Georgian or ogygian?</p>

<p>Modern Antique&mdash;The Turling Pin&mdash;The Duck Carver&mdash;Scotch
Measures&mdash;When Matches were Scarce&mdash;Wexford in Wales&mdash;Snuff-boxes
and Other Things.</p></div>


<p>I have only small collections of brass and copper to
exhibit, and my reasons for buying these you see were
mainly that often I had been poking about for pewter, and
finding none, rather than waste the shopkeeper’s time for
nothing I would purchase a bit of old brass or copper, if
I happened to notice any piece I judged worth having. It
is often difficult to identify old brass, and the quantity
of “antique” that was manufactured in Birmingham
alone, some years before the war, must have been very
extensive. I found it nearly everywhere I went, and still
see much of it about.</p>

<p>To instance the worth of my statement I remember,
when in Scotland, I mentioned to a collector friend that I
should like to have a turling pin, which is a combined
knocker and latch, for I had seen such a thing spoken of
in a book I had just been reading. Not long afterwards I
received a parcel containing a turling pin, which I found at
once was new brass that had been in an acid bath for
discoloration, and to give it the necessary old appearance.
My friend wrote that he had been fortunate in getting this
for 16s. and the antique dealer had assured him it had
come out of an old house at, I think, Inverness. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
returned the find, with thanks, and I do not know my
Scotsman if he failed to get his money back. I am still
without a turling pin, though I have one genuine old
knocker from Ripon, which is on a door where it ought
to be, so you will not find it on the photograph.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1911 I had a fine specimen of a corn
which I carried in my boot, and while in an antique shop
I knocked it against something black that had been put
on the floor to keep a door open. I looked down to see
what had caused the pain and my regrettable exclamation,
and was informed, “it was a lead ink-stand, and did
it hurt?” I knew it was decidedly hard metal from my
experience, so I gave half-a-crown for it, with the idea of
having my revenge by cleaning the clumsy brute, for he
had no right to be carving a duck in the beastly black
state he was in. This class of ink-stand was made in
Birmingham about eighty years ago.</p>

<p>Brass and copper as antiques have much to recommend
them, as no matter what state they may be in when
found, they can very soon be made presentable by a good
rubbing with metal polish. These metals preserve
themselves remarkably well for centuries, hence it is
that occasionally rare old specimens can be found by
anyone with their eyes skinned. The fine 12 in. brass pot,
with lion head ring handles and claw feet, I saw in a
second-hand shop at Buxton, and bought for seven
shillings, but I had to get a hamper to bring it home in.
I have other large things, such as warming-pans, chestnut
roaster, churchwarden pipe rack, gong, etc., but the
inclusion of these would have spoiled the effect of the
photograph, and the mortars get a “Course” on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
own. You will notice some Scotch thistle-shaped
measures; for these I am indebted to a young friend
who travelled a good deal, and often came back from
Scotland with pewter, brass, or copper. The measures
are stamped “Four gills,” “Pint,” “Gill,” “Half-Gill.”</p>

<p>Among the brass I hope you will be able to distinguish
two uncommon snuff-boxes. One is called “the Horn of
Plenty,” and is very old, while the other is hexagonal in
shape, is made of cherry wood and brass, and was
originally owned and used by Sir Ernest Shackleton’s
grandfather. The brass lamp with two snake handles
must have special mention. Inside, fitted on a thin
wooden circle, there are ten small metal cells, each
fitted with a match-head, also a piece of wick and
tallow; by pressing the handles together the disc makes
a slight turn, striking the match against a jagged fitting,
and stopping under the hole, through which the light
would (I suppose) burn, until the cell was empty. This
was patented about eighty years ago when matches were
first invented, but I do not anticipate many were sold,
as when all the lights had been burnt a fresh fitment would
have to replace the one exhausted, a rather expensive
affair.</p>

<p>Tacking brass and copper on to the many other
specialities I have gone in for may cause the remark that
had I confined myself to a more limited sphere I might
have had a finer result in fewer classes, but that would
have curtailed the pleasurable excitement of my rambles.
Then again, when once you get the collecting fever you
are not likely to get the better of it; it is far more likely
to get the better of you, and I am of opinion it is better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
so, provided you do not let it obtain an undue hold on
your pocket. It is undoubtedly hard at times to say
“No,” but it is more difficult to get rid of a bad bargain.
It is a singular trait of character, not altogether limited to
collectors, which impels the individual to tell everyone
when he secures anything cheap but constrains him to be
as close as an oyster when he is done with a “dud,” yet
the best tales usually most enjoyed by the hearers are
those which tell against the teller.</p>

<p>As regards the copper I am rather afraid of giving a
wrong designation to the lipped pan with wood handle.
It may have been a posset pot, or a beer-warmer, possibly
it was used for both purposes, though not at the same
time. The conical shaped warmer would put the pot to
bed, as it would heat the mulled ale much quicker by
being pushed down to the bottom of the fire, and, what
was of more consequence in those days, it held more. The
straight measure with a slot cut out at the top bears the
inscription “Standard I Pint of the Corporation of
Wexford Anno 1810” and is twice stamped “G.R. III.”
When I bought it I was assured by the broker that he
could swear it was genuine as he knew the man who
fetched it out of Wales. I bought this “eneuch
measure,” as a French visitor once called it to me, on
January 1, 1910, and I remember wondering if this find
augured well for the New Year from the collecting point
of view, and it turned out quite a prosperous one.</p>

<p>There is a peculiar pewter half-pint Glasgow measure
with copper top fitted with an overflow pipe, so that not
a drop of the precious liquor would be lost. The two-handled
measure is stamped “One-Pint,” so also is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
pedestal-shaped one next to it. I do not know the trade
name for the four measures with bell mouthpieces or
pouring spouts, but I found them and the fine jug at one
shop Bolton way. The small funnel is provided with
a strainer. There are two powder-flasks on the top and
two snuff-boxes on the bottom shelf. What sort of
spectacles ever fitted into that heavy spectacle case?
But one may conjecture everlastingly with these queer old
relics of bygone days and ways.</p>

<h2 id="FOURTH_COURSE"><i>FOURTH COURSE</i><br />
Old Mortars</h2>


<p>I shall only indulge in a short preliminary canter on this
course as there are few competitors, and the chances of
gaining a prize in this field are rather remote. I was
not long before I had bought several bronze mortars, all
plain, as I did not know fancy ones existed.</p>

<p>No. 1.&mdash;When I found this and bought it, I sent a
photograph to the editor of the <cite>Chemist and Druggist</cite>,
telling him it had been dredged up from the Liverpool
Docks. He submitted the photograph to an expert, and
reproduced the photograph in his paper in 1908 with the
following remarks:</p>

<p>“Here we have the new Prime Minister, Mr. Asquith
in effigy, on a two or three century old mortar. The
left projecting wing shows a profile very like that of
Mr. Asquith. The firmly sealed lips probably represent
the receptive condition of his mind when the suggestions
of subjects for new taxation fall upon his ear, and the
features between the profile may, perhaps, bear some
resemblance to the horrified expression worn by brewery
directors, and those interested in the ‘Trade’ generally,
on the morning following the introduction of the Licensing
Bill. The type is Portuguese or Spanish, and probably of
the sixteenth or seventeenth century. The projections,
which so resemble a human profile are a feature of this
type of Mortar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Size 5 in. diameter, 3½ in. high, weight 4 lbs.</p>

<p>This was encouraging, but put me out of conceit with
the plain ones with which I had stocked myself.</p>

<p>The Mortars illustrated are mostly of very uncommon
types, and as such specimens are seldom met with I hope
their inclusion will be found of interest to the reader
whose fancies may run in other directions. For after all,
rareness and scarcity are great factors to collectors.</p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;Bronze. I had great difficulty in deciphering
the lettering and figures on this owing to wear. They
are in two lines, and read “W. aged 69. 74 years Mary
and Thomas.” No doubt husband and wife, “W” being
the initial letter of their surname. 4½ in. across the
top, 4½ in. high, weight 4 lbs.</p>

<p>No. 3.&mdash;Bronze. This has upon it a fleur-de-lis, and
mitre ornament and would no doubt be seventeenth
century. 5½ in. across the top, 4½ in. high, weight 3 lbs.</p>

<p>No. 4.&mdash;Bronze. Is a very unusual type in that
it has only one handle, while the ornament is artistic.
I noticed, soon after I bought this, that an old one-handled
metal mortar had been fished up from the
Spanish Armada wreck, in Tobermory Bay. 5 in.
across top, height 4 in., weight 3 lbs. 2 oz.</p>

<p>No. 5 is made of bright yellow metal. It is 5 in. in
diameter, 4 in. high, weighs 3 lb., and has been well
finished. Its decoration consists of “C.R.” repeated
four times, crowned Tudor-rose, thistle, trefoil, and
crowned heart, each divided by a small fleur-de-lis. It
was no doubt made by a loyal workman at the restoration
of Charles II., and is, I hope, unique. I had trouble when
negotiating the purchase, as through a side-slip I divulged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
that the initials of Charles Rex were the same as my own.
Further, the holder was convinced that this mortar had
belonged to “the Royal Culinary Department, and was
almost worth its weight in gold.” In the end he was
converted and evidently satisfied, for he foraged around
and gave me an old pestle <em>after</em> I had paid the money.</p>

<p>No. 6 is bronze, 5¼ in. in diameter at the top, 4 in.
high, and weighs 4½ lb. When roaming about Kendal on
an Easter Sunday I found this standing among “Roman”
antiquities in a shop. I bought it on Easter Monday, and
am still wondering how old it really is, and how many
centuries the antiquary was out in his reckoning. Its
appearance in every way indicates great age.</p>

<p>No. 7 is a bronze mortar 6 in. in diameter, 4½ in. high,
No. 7 is a bronze mortar 6 in. in diameter, 4½ in. high,
weighs 6¼ lb., bears the letters <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2em;">W<span style="vertical-align: 100%;">H</span>S&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> also 1735, and is the
only dated mortar I possess. It belonged to an old
Lancashire family named Hartley. W and S “rang off”
some time since, and their Christian names were not
ascertained.</p>

<p>No. 8 is the largest and heaviest bronze mortar I
have. It is 7 in. in diameter, 5½ in. high, and weighs 13 lb.
The decoration is very crude, and I was puzzled as to the
meaning until I turned it upside down, when a ram’s head
and a shell were evident. In this position the shape takes
the form of a bell, and indicates that the makers would use
the same mould for bells as for mortars at the period about
1650. I found this just across the Welsh border in
Flintshire and had a hard time.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Plate XXXI.</span></p></div>
</div></div>

<p>No. 9.&mdash;This “Goblet” is a most unusual shape for
a brass mortar, and the metal is quite yellow. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
pleased when I found it, and more so when the owner
gladly gave it me in exchange for three plain ones of the
usual pattern. 4½ in. across top, 5 in. high, weight
4 lbs. 4 ozs.</p>

<p>No. 10. is 7 in. in diameter by 4¼ in. high. After
acquiring this I ascertained that the difference between
alabaster and marble is that the former is of a softer
nature, which accounts for the head of the old pestle being
worn to 1½ in. One of the four lugs is grooved for convenience
when pouring out fluid mixtures&mdash;no doubt
the innovation of an up-to-date cash chemist of that
go-ahead period.</p>

<p>I have another of an exactly similar character, but
12 inches in diameter, while it has no groove, and an
old Waterford glass pestle is with it. The pestles belonging
to the metal mortars are all of different patterns.</p>

<p>Pottery opens a wide course, gives much chance of
success, finds scope for research and discrimination, and
has also the advantage of not taking up much room, so
the collector can usually hang on to anything he may
fancy. In hunting for antiques you get exercise, a certain
amount of excitement, and a great deal of uncertainty.
It is a fine school for cultivating patience which repays
you in the long run. I have times innumerable gone out
of my way to pass a certain shop, to be rewarded, quite
recently, by finding half a dozen blue and white pottery
plates of a pattern I have wanted for years. This was
doubly consoling, for my previous purchase there was
broken in my pocket. In doing my own collecting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
pottery I have had many strange experiences, and several
of the pieces have some interesting incident associated
with their coming into my possession. As they total over
250 specimens the reminiscences make good reflections,
while the finding, tracing, naming and arranging for
show on shelves or whatnots to the best advantage has
enabled me to pass many and many an hour pleasantly,
and the result is always gratifying.</p>

<p>Whenever I chance to be from home I make it a part
of my programme to do the old shops; sometimes the
old shops do me, but not often. I recently went round the
shops of a seaside town and drew a blank, but I saw a jug
dated 1806 which I liked. On handling it I was informed
it was an old Staffordshire farmer’s jug, with farm
implements painted on. The price was £10, and they had
already refused £6. I felt uneasy until I had put the
jug back on the shelf. In contrast to that, in almost
the last inland town I visited by road we pulled up near
a second-hand place and the first thing I noticed was a
quaint-shaped, very early Staffordshire jug, hand painted,
with blue band and some floral decoration, and so I went
in. Blowing off the dust which other collectors had
failed to disturb, although the town is their hunting-ground,
I was told I could have it for a shilling as it was
a bit snipped at the bottom. I bought that jug, and I
should have been quite ready and pleased to buy the
other at a reasonable price. My plough jug cost me
five shillings in 1911; it is not dated, but may possibly be
prior to 1806.</p>

<p>Soon after I set up in the pottery line I espied an
old two-handled Wesleyan loving cup, with “<span class="smcap">Bethel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></span>”
painted on the sides in black. While I was examining
the mug an elderly gentleman came in from the back
room and the following enlightening conversation ensued:</p>

<dl>
        <dt><i>Moderato</i>:</dt>
                <dd class="iq">Good afternoon.</dd>
                <dd>Eh?</dd>
        <dt><i>Crescendo</i>:</dt>
                <dd>How much for the mug?</dd>
                <dd>Thruppence.</dd>
        <dt><i>Forte</i>:</dt>
                <dd>Where did it come from?</dd>

                <dd>How old do you consider it?</dd>
                <dd>Thruppence.</dd>
        <dt><i>Piano</i>:</dt>
                <dd>Oh, help!</dd>
</dl>

<p>I saw the figure of “Wesley over the Clock” in a
small grocery window, and on asking if it was for sale was
told “Yes! We are sick to death of seeing him on the
mantel”&mdash;and then bang went saxpence.</p>

<p>After these reckless purchases it is consoling to
remember that the bust of Whitfield by Enoch Wood was
given me by a neighbour who fished it out of his lumber
room. (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXXII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXII</span></a>).</p>

<p>I purchased several pieces at odd times from a man
who spoke Yiddish to his wife and broken English to me,
and no matter whether the article was Wheildon, Wedgwood,
or Worcester, he invariably assured me “It was a
fine bit of old Zwanzee.”</p>

<p>On the shelves round two of my rooms I have some
quite uncommon dark blue printed plates and dishes,
some unmarked, others by Rogers, Challenor, Adams,
Spode, Davenport, Turner, also part set of a dinner
service with fine illustrations of Pera, Mosque in Latachia,
Triumphal Arch, Latachia, Pillar of Absalom. I also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
have the tureen, which illustrates Eski-Estamboul. One
of the dishes is marked “B” and they can with safety be
attributed to the Burtons of Hanley, 1820.</p>

<p>A dish in rich blue, illustrating Little Boy Blue blowing
his horn for the cows in the meadow and the sheep in the
corn; I fail to identify the cow and surmise that on this
particular farm these animals must have been very much
alike. I espied the rim of this dish nearly hidden on the
shelf of a broker and I enquired, “Is that a blue and
white dish?” and was answered, “Yes, but it’s more
than you’ll pay, we are saving that for a swell who comes
in a motor-car.” After this, of course I had to see it, and
ascertaining the price paid up at once. I left my name and
address and they promised to let me know if they got
anything more like it. A few weeks later I received a
postcard and caught the earliest train in great expectancy,
to find on my arrival a few Willow Pattern dishes. I
left these to swell the swell motorist’s collection.</p>

<p>Never mind the absence of marks on the back, for if
you desire to decorate you want good illustrations, and
these are the main consideration. When a visitor, after
contemplating these plates for a time, remarks, “I like
your Willow Pattern” when there is no Willow Pattern
on view, I usually change the subject and switch on
to domestics, as I find so many people are on the
look out for these, and I gather from the conversation
that in collecting them they have the greatest difficulty
in finding good specimens to add lustre and charm to the
home.</p>

<h3>SALT GLAZE</h3>

<p>Readers who are familiar with salt glaze will not
be surprised when I say that the four pieces shown
on <a href="#PLATE_XXXV">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXV</span></a> are all that I have fit to be trotted
out, and they will probably not be taken aback when
I confess to having been absolutely bewildered for some
time in distinguishing this class of pottery. I read of
£50 being given at, I think, the Bemrose Sale for a
little ugly group, and I felt a desire to find something
of this sort, though at a somewhat less fancy price.
I poked in many a dusty cupboard, and messed myself
up continuously for a time, until one day in an
auctioneer’s stock-room I dug out a white coffee pot
with a pewter lid which I felt sure was salt glaze. When
the auctioneer told me I could have it for two shillings
if it was any good to me, I thought how little he knew
of his business. It takes two to make a bargain, and
he was not the fool. I found the coffee pot was salt
glaze, but only about fifty years old, so it is again hidden
away in a cupboard. I had looked at bits of salt glaze
in glass cases under lock and key, so I think of presenting
this piece to some museum where, owing to its comparatively
small value, visitors may be allowed to touch
and examine it under a magnifying glass, but I should
first have it labelled, “Caution to Collectors&mdash;this is
the class of salt glaze to avoid.” This dud purchase
turned out to be rather fortunate than otherwise, as
after winking at it for a week I went carefully through
my collection and found three salt glaze pieces which
had remained unidentified for two years past. They are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
a jug painted and gilded over the glaze, and which I
had bought in my ignorance in Wakefield; a little
crudely painted lustre Staffordshire jug, which I caught
busy catching the drips from a paraffin tap and secured
for a trifle; and a blue painted castor-oil spoon.</p>

<p>Later I added a salt glaze delft dish with mark
showing it was made by Petit of Lille, about 1788,
which proves that the statement made in more than
one book on old pottery that no delft was salt glazed
is incorrect. This particular dish came from Sir J. D.
Forest’s collection.</p>

<p>Anyone with a Castleford teapot will be struck with
its likeness to salt glaze. I happened on one in a town
where the manufacture of heavy chemicals is very
evident in the atmosphere, and the brokeress said she
had been told that the teapot was “salt-<em>cake</em>.” The
same good old lady was once kind enough to invite
me to step up to her bedroom, and a very nice room
it was, its cleanliness, contents and comfort being greatly
at variance with the shop and store-room below. Among
the ornaments of which she offered me the choice was
a fine “Cobbler’s Wife,” 12 inches high, probably
Rockingham, which she had bought at a sale, and was
pleased to part with at a profit. I have searched for
years for the “Cobbler,” but have failed to trace him.
If anyone knows his present address, and will communicate
with the author, they will be suitably rewarded.</p>


<h3>TOBY JUGS (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXXIII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXIII</span></a>)</h3>

<p>None of these Toby jugs have any maker’s names
on them, but I believe the large and small of the same
design are by Davenport. “The Squire” appears to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
be the oldest, but whether it or the “Hearty Good
Fellow” is the most valuable from a collector’s point
of view I cannot say, and I will tell you why. My
first impression of “The Squire,” which I obtained
through a window, was “What a beauty!” I had
seen a letter in the <cite>Connoisseur</cite> just before giving a photograph
of one like it, so I was on the alert at once. Enquiry
elicited the information that the dealer thought
it was really old, that he bought it off a man who looked
through the shop door, then went away and came back
when the dealer was disengaged. “I didn’t know the
man; apparently he was hard up&mdash;wouldn’t give any
name, but he wanted a sovereign, so I gave it him,
and you can have the jug for twenty-five shillings.”</p>

<p>I have heard of a dog having a bad name, though
Toby isn’t a bad name for a dog, but I soon came up
against a Toby with a bad name. On mentioning to
my late friend the collector-dealer my purchase of
“The Squire,” what I had given for it, and where I
bought it, he said he was sorry to hear it. He had
seen that Toby and would not touch it, as he had been
warned against it by another dealer, and if I wished
for another like it he could give me an address in the
Potteries where I might get one for 3s. 11d. The next
time he was at my house he was hard to convince that
he was mistaken; but when I told him I had shown
it to a practical potter, who cautioned me that if I
filled it with water I must not carry it by the handle,
as it was partly perished with age, he gave in. Not
long after I chanced to meet near home a well-known
dealer who had just come from Harrogate to attend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
a sale of antiques in our neighbourhood and who enquired
of me the way. I asked him to have lunch
with us and offered to drive him to the sale later. I
am afraid this was rather diluted hospitality, for I was
desirous of having his opinion of, among other things,
“The Squire.” After careful examination he pronounced
it genuine, but he seemed to fancy the “Hearty
Good Fellow” more.</p>

<p>When I first saw the “Hearty Good Fellow” it
was in a window mainly given up to the display of
modern ironmongery, and on enquiring the price was
disappointed to hear it was sold and that a man was
calling for it later. Then I said, “Ask him what he
will take for his bargain, and don’t you part with it.”
I am not sure how much I slept that night, but I know
I called on my way to business, and I spent a bright
and happy morning with the “Hearty Good Fellow”
on my desk.</p>

<p>I had an amusing experience when purchasing “Uncle
Toby,” for when the dealer asked me 25s. I was able
to say (having had a look at the bottom of the jug)
that it was marked in ink 15s. When I showed him
this he let himself go, and if the female assistant&mdash;who
was not about at the time&mdash;had heard one tithe of
the forcible expressions of opinion in which he held
her business acumen, she would have gone into service
straight away, for among her qualifications he considered
she was more fit for cooking potatoes in their
jackets. I refer to this gentleman elsewhere as having
some temper, but on this occasion I waited patiently
until he had come down to nearly normal, bought some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
other things, and got “Uncle Toby” at the price (15s.)
on which he still sits.</p>

<p>Toby teapots must be scarce. I have seen none
other, except in 1915, when I noticed two in a shop
window on the Pantiles at Tunbridge Wells. I obtained
mine through the death of an old lady who lived in
our locality.</p>


<h3>LIVERPOOL POTTERY (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXXV">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXV</span></a>)</h3>

<p>To identify all the Liverpool pottery one may come
across as being made in Liverpool is wellnigh impossible;
the various factories seem each to have had some special
features, while many of the jugs are very like those
made by old Staffordshire firms. I say this partly by
way of apology, as it is more than likely I have put
under this group some jugs made elsewhere, and the
same remark may apply to odd jugs in the Staffordshire
group; but as I am not out to sell the things I
cannot see that I lay myself out to any serious charge
of misrepresentation. If you are of a different opinion,
then I must plead that I have no fraudulent intent.</p>

<p>Away back in the days beyond recall an authority
on this subject very kindly came out here and named
my specimens as far as he could, but I notice among
the labels I had then affixed the word “probably” sometimes
appears before the name given. I was somewhat
disappointed with the result of his visit, for he pronounced
some of the jugs which I had hoped were Liverpool
as not coming within that family, so I have decided
to be my own judge in future, as by that means I may
in time have one of the largest collections of “Old Liverpool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>”
in the country. As those I include will be so
near in appearance to some of the varieties made, I
am hoping no collector will have reason to dispute
my classification. Only one jug is marked, and that
has a letter “P,” which denotes Pennington, and I
spotted this mark without a suspicious dealer&mdash;to whose
astuteness I refer later on&mdash;being aware of the fact,
and so I got it for 3s., which is not an excessive price
considering it is hand painted with line decoration, an
uncommon design, and bears a very rare mark.</p>

<p>Collectors should be careful how they clean Old
Liverpool which has been printed over the glaze, for
I remember on one occasion I gave a sovereign for a
jug with pictures done in brown which had a smudgy
look. The dealer was a straight man, and said if I
was not satisfied he would give me my money back.
When I got home and filled the bathroom hand-basin
with hot water and soda and began cleaning, I thought
what a dirty condition the jug must be in, for the water
soon began to look like brown ink. I thought it was
time to probe deeper, and to my alarm found the picture
still blurred, but not so dark in colour, and then
I thought I was “done in brown”! I saw the dealer
and told him all about it. When he asked was I not
satisfied, I admitted I was not altogether enamoured
with the running thing, and that it was the pictures
by the Old Master I placed such value on, so he laughingly
returned the money.</p>

<p>A collector from the south came along soon after
and gave the dealer more than the even sovereign.
My only wonder is how many times that jug has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
been washed since, and how much of the pictures
remain.</p>

<p>A jug 8½ inches high shows “King William, Prince
of Orange,” on horseback, and on the reverse side a
print of Britannia and Erin throttling a snake coiled
round a broken pillar, also the words “Great Britain
and Ireland United <span class="smcap2">MDCCC</span>.” One 7-inch jug has an
heraldic illustration headed “The Cooper’s Arms,” and
on the reverse side a lion and anchor surmounted by
“Great Britain and Ireland United 1800.” A specially
fine specimen of Herculaneum pottery is the 7½-inch
jug of uncommon pattern which gives the “Duke of
York” and “Prince Coburg” in relief, and this jug is
painted in the old delft colours, brown, yellow, orange
and blue. The cups and saucers bear portraits of
Washington and Lafayette; they must have missed
the American boat over a hundred years ago, or I should
not have found them in Wigan, and they were undoubtedly
made for the American market.</p>


<h3>SUNDERLAND (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXXIV">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXIV</span></a>)</h3>

<p>Many of these jugs and mugs are very quaint, but
it is to me impossible always to identify them. One
evidently commemorates the opening of the cast-iron
bridge over the River Wear on August 9th, 1796. The
fact that maritime subjects were often used for illustration
assists in deciding sometimes, so I include the
frog-mug. Lake lustre and yellow lustre were largely
used, the colours being brushed on in a careless
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>


<h3>DON POTTERY (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXXV">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXV</span></a>)</h3>

<p>So much pottery was made without indication of
its origin that it is well for a collector when he comes
across a marked piece cheap, even if it is imperfect,
to procure it. In 1915 I bought a pedestal oval-shaped
bowl which bears the distinction of being the only piece
in my collection which did not cost me more than 2d.
It looked as if it had spent half its long life in an oven
and most of the remainder in being knocked about, for
both handles were off. I saw it was impressed “Don
Pottery” and knew it would be made in Leeds about
1780, that it bore traces of being printed in black transfer
at Liverpool, that it had been banded black by hand,
and that the colour of the ware was of a dark grey cast.
In June, 1919, I saw the uncommon plate shown in
this group bearing many features tallying with the
Don Pottery bowl but in perfect condition (unmarked),
having also a silver lustre band, and on comparing these
pieces satisfied myself they both came from the same
factory. Such finds as these, trifling though they may
be, help to make collecting a pastime.</p>


<h3>TURNER LANE ENDS (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXXVI">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXVI</span></a>)</h3>

<p>In 1911, in an old shop at Prescot, near the house in
which Kemble lived, I discovered a well-printed blue-and-white
dish impressed “Turner” and bought it,
finding a place for it on the shelf over the mantel.
Three years after I was in a manufacturing town 25
miles away looking about, and in a sort of a marine store
window noticed a tureen (unmarked) with ladle com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>plete
which matched my Turner dish. Enquiring the
price, the woman said “she didn’t know,” and “he
was out.” So I asked her to fetch “him.” When
“he” arrived, somewhat fuddled, I asked him the
price, and on getting his answer remarked it seemed a
bit stiff, when he huffily and huskily replied, “Why,
the &mdash;&mdash; ladle’s worth the money,” and left me straightaway.
With an assurance like that from such an
authority I decided to buy. I knocked, and my lady
friend appeared again and anxiously put the question:</p>

<p>“Did you pay him?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good thing; I’ll have the money.”</p>

<p>The tureen has since adorned my mantel, and it
might have been a part of the same set as the dish.
I recently found at a Red Cross sale a little pickle-holder
to match. I once priced a larger dish of the
same pattern, but owing to the difficulty of getting
it home left it, and the next time I was in that town
it had been sold.</p>


<h3>WEDGWOOD (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXXII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXII</span></a>)</h3>

<p>Josiah Wedgwood must have been a wonderful man,
and I am pleased to have a portrait of him on a jug
bearing his name on a scroll with the dates “1730 to
1795.” I believe this to be a Centenary piece, and as
his works started in 1752 the jug will be about seventy
years old. I have seen so much of Wedgwood’s Jasper
Ware that I have refrained from buying any, but I
show two small pieces&mdash;a really old pepper-pot and
a sugar bowl (part of a set here)&mdash;which I did not collect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Early on I placed the teapot, sugar bowl, and
cream jug in my china cabinet, but as so many visitors
after running their eyes over my rarer specimens
usually remarked, “I see you have some Wedgwood,”
I put them out of sight. This Jasper Ware has had a
tremendous sale for years and years, and is better known
than its age. For these three things I substituted a
Jasper spill vase, and many a spill has been caused by
the knowing ones calling this Wedgwood, when it is
not.</p>

<p>I have been lucky in finding some early specimens
of Wedgwood&mdash;a plate impressed “Pearl,” printed but
touched up by hand, a pair of tortoise-shell (back and
front) plates with raised daisy and bead border. One
plate, octagonal shape, cupids dancing in centre, with
a remarkable light and shade effect, with oak-leaf relief
border, and having a fine tortoise-shell back. All
these are heavy and have “Wedgwood” stamped in
large type, so they will date 1760 to 1765. These are
followed by a Cream-ware plate, partly hand coloured,
and a little later by a plate of a whiter shade giving
a brown printed view of sailing vessels in harbour.
These have the impressed mark in smaller type. Two
little teapots, one black basalt and the other bisque
pattern, about 1780, complete this interesting group.</p>

<p>Another excellent specimen of Queen’s Ware will be
seen on shelf No. 1, <a href="#PLATE_XXXIII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXIII</span></a>. This bears the early
large type Wedgwood impressed mark, and has the
lug and feather border carefully painted in brown and
red over the glaze. As my ten plates&mdash;two of which
were given me&mdash;have cost me just half the price I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
was once asked for a single cracked tortoise-shell plate,
I conclude I have been working on right lines.</p>


<h3>PUZZLE JUGS (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXXIV">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXIV</span></a>)</h3>

<p>With the intention of describing to the reader the
peculiarities of these jugs and the difference in the
puzzles, I have just had the six filled with water to
experiment with so that I might give lucid explanations
of the enigmas, and I have been most successful&mdash;in
making myself wet. That the investigation should
be complete, I obtained the assistance of a young friend
who revels in logarithms and abstruse problems, and
as I noticed signs of his temper giving way under his
many efforts to elucidate the why and the wherefore
of these strange devices and their tricky behaviour,
the enquiry is postponed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine die</i>.</p>

<p>Of the two brown stoneware jugs the one with
figures in relief hails from Brampton, and the other
would have been made in some local pottery. The
tall, fancy shape is a good specimen of those made
at Leeds. The one with the pantomime group would
be made in Staffordshire about eighty years ago,
while the Harlequin jug was the work of Elsmore
and Forster, about 1850. The white jug is the oldest
of the tribe, and I should be surprised to hear of another
like it being in existence. I fancy this to be the work
of an industrious apprentice to show what a clever
hand he was, and that the letters “G. B.” scratched
on the bottom under the glaze will be his initials. I
wish he had not given in his tally before he had added
a date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>


<h3>NELSON JUGS (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXXII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXII</span></a>)</h3>

<p>The jug almost covered with blue printing is a fine
specimen, showing Nelson, the <cite>Victory</cite>, and a list of his
titles and his battles, together with his famed last signal
and some eulogy. The jug with Nelson in relief bears
on the reverse side a likeness of Hardy, and it is in
such good condition that I believe the party I bought
it from in Liverpool thought it was a reproduction,
while I felt quite satisfied that it was a specially well
preserved antique. The black printed jug is a disreputable-looking
relic, and when found it appeared as
if it had been in the battle of Trafalgar instead of
commemorating the fight, for the jug had “got it in
the neck” and had lost its handle. As the printing
was all there I decided to salve it, and after going
into dry dock it came out looking quite spick and span.
Dampness, followed by a spell of hard frost, penetrating
where it was berthed, shivered its timbers, and so
you see the paint and enamel coming off. I give this as
a warning to any collector who may pay about half a
sovereign to get a piece of old pottery overhauled to
ever after keep it in a warm, dry place and not to
touch it unless compelled.</p>


<h3>MASK JUGS (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXXIV">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXIV</span></a>)</h3>

<p>My advice is, it you can buy old jugs like these two
at a reasonable price, do so. You would not be able
to see the handle of the one which faces the audience
if it were in profile, for some “daft budy” had knocked
it off before I came along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>


<h3>DELFT (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXXV">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXV</span></a>)</h3>

<p>An amateur will find it difficult to get to know this
when he finds it, but he will find it still more difficult
to find it before he gets it. I think something of what
I have, especially one 9-inch plate with coloured design,
Liverpool Fazakerley pattern, and someone must have
thought quite a lot of it before I gave a shilling for it,
as they went to the trouble of breaking it and to the
expense of having the pieces fastened together again
with seventeen rivets. The two other coloured plates
are not yet identified, while the hand-painted blue
plate is semi-porcelain. The French candlestick, richly
decorated by hand, bears the mark of Widow Perrin,
of Marseilles, 1770. It was sold to me as a sauce-boat,
and when I enquired the meaning of the chimney in
the centre was answered, “How should I know?”</p>

<p>A large Bristol Delft dish, blue painted, figures at
the top of the pictorial pottery on <a href="#PLATE_XXXVI">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXVI</span></a>.</p>

<p>Twentieth-century Dutch delft is not antique; I
have been where it was in the making in Holland and
seen it on sale in old shops in England.</p>


<h3>ROCKINGHAM (BROWN) (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXXIII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXIII</span></a>)</h3>

<p>I am fortunate in having a Cadogan pot impressed
“Rockingham,” as by comparing I believe I have only
included brown ware made at this factory. Brown
“Rockingham” snuff-taker jugs have been made elsewhere
by the thousand.</p>


<h3>LUSTRE (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXXIII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXIII</span></a>)</h3>

<p>I have chosen for this group what I consider the
best of my bunch, which consists of gilt, copper, silver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
lake, brown, and yellow lustres. The only marked one
shows that J. Aynsley was using lustre about 1800.
My largest copper lustre jug bears the first owner’s
initials, “W.P., 1823,” while the silver lustre cannon is
lettered “Battle of Wagram, 1806,” so I can only surmise
that most of these exhibits were made in the first
half of the nineteenth century. The main difference
between the modern and old lustre ware is usually noticeable
on the bottom of the pieces, the finish of the old
being more carefully executed.</p>


<h3>WOOD, ENOCH AND RALPH (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXXII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXII</span></a>)</h3>

<p>All students or collectors of old pottery will be
anxious to have authentic representations of the work
of these early potters. I was lucky in having the bust
of Whitfield given to me, and I am convinced this is
genuine. I have tried to procure Enoch Wood’s companion
bust of Wesley, but the two I have had offered
were reproductions, the features not being so sharp
and the impress mark blurred and indistinct. Ralph
Wood had a great reputation as an engraver of moulds,
and this is certainly justified by my large light blue
enamelled jug, impressed “Wood.” I also show an
early brown printed plate impressed “Wood” beside
the word “Ivory,” which plate will probably be contemporary
with the Wedgwood “Pearl.”</p>


<h3>BROWN AND BUFF STONEWARE (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXXIV">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXIV</span></a>)</h3>

<p>The Doulton Jubilee Jug dated 1887 is probably
the most modern of the pieces photographed, but the
small jug next it will make up for the matter of age if
it is Old Fulham, as I believe it to be. The jug with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
hunting scenes in relief is stamped Copeland, while
the small “salt” with lion-head ends is by W. Briddon,
and would be made in Chesterfield about 1770. This
and the Fulham jug are salt glaze.</p>

<p>I have omitted to include a Spode buff mug with
lion-head handle and blue rim giving “Wellington,
with soldiers and a cannon” (9.2 in.), also a Continental
tree with huge leaves in white relief commemorating the
Battle of Vittoria, 1813.</p>


<h3>TRANSFER PRINTING</h3>

<p>Anyone interested in the evolution of this art would
find in my collection enough specimens to point out
the advancement as time went on, and evidence that
not many years elapsed before the printing was all that
it need to be. My earliest example is an irregular wavy
edged 7½-inch plate, the glaze of which looks like thin
tin enamel, and over this glaze there is a quaint picture
of a woman and child in a garden under a palm
tree, of course. To add to the impression that this is
a very early effort at stipple printing on pottery there
is a white line running nearly across the print, denoting
the paper had either been torn or the blue ink had not
entirely covered it. The plate is crazed all over like
a fine spider’s web. The sauce-boat described on <a href="#PLATE_XXXVI">Plate
<span class="smcap2">XXXVI</span></a> as printed over the glaze, probably dates next,
and then must come a study of a 10-inch cream-coloured
ware soup-plate. This is not among the pieces photographed,
as I have only just discovered its peculiarities,
which, now they have secured my attention, strike me
as remarkable. It is the heaviest plate of its size I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
have, and weighs 1 lb. 9 oz.; it is well made, and is
in good preservation. It is printed over the glaze with
fern leaves and common English flowers, like poppies,
lilies, and harebells, the stalks and foliage in green
transfer, while the flowers are enamelled red and yellow
by hand. With difficulty I have made out the mark
to be an impressed crown, and this, together with the
colour of the ware, satisfies me that it is an early piece
of Herculaneum. It was pushed on to me nine years
ago by a dealer, instead of a shilling change out of a
sovereign, with the remark, “Perhaps you would rather
take that plate,” and I did not wish to disappoint him
by declining anything he desired to be rid of. Readers
will do well not to miss any transfer printing over the
glaze, and the search for it will keep them busy.</p>


<h3>NOTES ON THE GROUPS</h3>

<p>I now come to the arranging of the groups of the
many jugs and pieces which I know are worthy of being
shown, and I find I am up against the difficulty caused
by so few of the makers marking their wares. The
advantages of the markings on pottery are twofold.
In the first place, you get a guide to the age of the
piece, also an idea of the class of work the maker mainly
went in for. Secondly, you can guess at the age fairly
well of pieces made by other makers who copied the
designs. By the Cottage Jug I know I have some
Whieldon, but how much more I cannot say, so I shall
confine my efforts in this direction to the endeavour to
make the photographs a guide as to age, and I believe
I can show that the period from 1750 to 1850 is covered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
The style of the earliest specimens is so pronounced
there is little difficulty in picking them out. The large
jug with a farm-house painted on it bears on the front,
“T. Clare, 1805,” which helps me to fix the date of others
with somewhat similar handpainting. Then the illustrations
give a clue, for instance, the Duke of Wellington
and General Hill, Nelson and Hardy, Princess Royal
and Prince of Prussia, Queen Caroline of England, pictures
of the stage coach, prize-fighting, cock-fighting,
the first railway trains, Disraeli and the Earl of Derby,
Gladstone and John Bright, George IVth died 1830,
Grace Darling died 1842, and, to end the list
happily, a plate, cup, and saucer printed in green,
“Commemorating Sir W. W. Wynn attaining his majority
1841.”</p>

<p>Photographic readers may be interested to know
that I have used the same set of shelves for the pottery
that I used for the metal subjects, but covered
with brown paper for the former and white for the
latter. A few of the light blue items are rather disappointing;
these, of course, required less exposure
than the darker colours, but I could not separate them
all from the groups to which they belong. The groups
have required six negatives, but they have had eight
exposures. After the first six operations I sent the
three slides to my developer, who reported Numbers 1,
2, 3, and 4 as “quite good,” but Numbers 5 and 6 had
“no plates in them,” so the result failed to reach the
high pitch of efficiency to which I had aspired. The
groups had to be rearranged another day, and the slides
chanced to be filled that time.</p>

<p>On a Staffordshire jug, probably made by Daniels,
and transfer printed with a picture of an old dandy,
who has a paper headed “Oracle” on his knee, and
whom the artist has crowned with a wig that would
stuff a furnish-on-the-hire-system settee:</p>

<div class="pcont"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Long may we live,</div>
<div class="verse">Happy may we be,</div>
<div class="verse">Blessed with content,</div>
<div class="verse">And from misfortunes free.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>On a small plate with a rim edged with red, which
carries the alphabet in raised letters, I see a quaint
print of two men, one holding his hat in his hand, the
other has his right hand thrust in his vest, while the
left is in the flap pocket of his knee breeches. There
is, of course, a cow, one sheep, and a lamb. In the
background there is a thatched roof covering some
house from out of which a lady, who appears to have
donned her shop-soiled sables, has brought into the
road a stool and a spinning-wheel. She is sitting on
the former while she works the latter. It is a quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
road, and no motors are anticipated. The artist has
wonderfully conveyed the idea that they are having
a very warm time, and that the “Johnnies” are having
a heated argument; further, it is the fly season, or
why is the cow whisking her tail? It is a peaceful
scene, for not a leaf stirs, and it is small wonder that
the author has been carried away from his object, which
was to report that at the top of the illustration there
is printed:</p>

<div class="bq">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Poor Richard’s Maxims</span></p>

<p>“Fly pleasure and it will follow you; the diligent spinner
has a large shirt.”</p></div>

<p class="uni">While at the foot every child can read:</p>


<div class="bq">

<p>“Now I have a sheep and a cow everybody bids me
good morrow.”</p></div>

<p>So I conclude the diligent spinner whose hands are
hidden by his clothing is bothered by too large a shirt
on this hot day, and that he is such a super-diligent
spinner that he sees his wife does the spinning while he
swanks about counting the cow, sheep, and lamb, and
is accosted by an indigent acquaintance who is anxious
to negotiate a loan&mdash;hence the heated argument.</p>


<h3>WILLOW PATTERN (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XXXVII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXVII</span></a>)</h3>

<p>Of course, everyone knows the Willow Pattern; if
not, they fancy they do, and it was only natural that
the first old looking dish I met with I bought. It was
marked “stoneware K. &amp; B.”; there was also a small
cross in blue. I couldn’t find “K. &amp; B.” in the book
I then had, but I found a cross was a Bristol mark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
so I concluded the dish was old Bristol, whereas it
would be made by Knight and Bridgewood in Staffordshire.
Then I bought other Willow Pattern plates and
dishes, some marked on the back and some not, and
found there were no two actually alike. On reference
I found that the Willow Pattern was the original design
of Thomas Minton, made for Thomas Turner, of Caughley,
so I turn(er)ed to my guide books to look for a reproduction
of the genuine picture, and I found each author showed
photographs which differed in many particulars, but
some specially recommended marks “C” or “S” and
I surmise that we may take it that “C” is the most
original of all the originals.</p>

<p>As I was growing older every day, and wished to
solve this Anglo-Chinese problem for the benefit of a
bewildered brain, I rambled farther afield, and at last
discovered a dish marked “S,” this being the mark
of the Salopian works which were early in the market
with this remarkable design. When I found another
dish marked “S,” I exchanged two of my mongrels
for it, and I repeated this bargain when I found a third.
I use the word “bargain” from the shopkeepers’ point
of view, as they would by my generous treatment receive
double from their sale than they had previously
expected. One of them told me I was too good-natured
ever to be well off, and I think he was a man of keen
perception of character, but it is disconcerting if a bank-book
can be revealed by the face, or by the old Burberry
worn on the back. Having a trio of the genuine
article, each one “bought” at different places, on comparing
I found the pictures identical, although the blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
varied slightly, and so I recommend the reader, if he
is interested in this grave question, to study <a href="#PLATE_XXXVII">Plate
<span class="smcap2">XXXVII</span></a>.</p>

<p>My cue is to look at the wagtails or love birds, and
if the one on the off side is a cock and carries his wings
perpendicularly, or if she is a hen and, after looping
the loop, has also acquired the same wing position,
which appears to be just the right one for billing and
cooing, then it is about time for the collector to turn-er-over
and see if there is anything more fascinating than
a love story on the back of the piece.</p>

<p>To make myself doubly clear, and to remove any
possible doubt whatsoever, I give an illustration of
another Willow Pattern dish which has no mark, and
is, to my mind, worth half a dozen of the “S” specimen
as an antique, for it must be fifty years older, is a better
shape, and a nicer blue. I obtained a pair of these from
an auctioneer, one being broken in two, and whether
I gave him three shillings for the whole one or for the
whole lot I am uncertain, and so I cannot make up
my pottery account, for I am unable to say the exact
number of pieces I have bought. I rather think he
sold me the whole one, and gave me the two halves;
he certainly did not knock down the lot, or both the
dishes would have been broken. With some stuff that
is guaranteed to stick everything, on two occasions I
joined the two halves, but each time they fell apart
a while after. As the third time is like no other my
reward for perseverance was that they held together
until I nearly got the dish on the shelf, when half
fell on the floor, broke in many pieces, and I dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the other on the top of them in disgust. I suppose
those uneasy birds started carrying-on, and the cement
did not have a proper chance to set.</p>

<p>I shall now have to photograph No. 2, and I must
see those cuckoos maintain their present positions.</p>

<p>“Birdie, come here a minute and help me take a
photo. You keep an eye on that off-side budgeregar,
and see he doesn’t budge, while I put a W.P. plate in
the slide.”</p>

<p>“Hurry up, dad&mdash;they’re gliding.”</p>

<p>“A’hem! they’ve shifted&mdash;so like a bird to move;
it’s a snapshot anyway.”</p>

<p>A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, but
when they are in the air, and you haven’t got your gun,&mdash;well,
there you are. Talk about Willow Pattern&mdash;but
those flighty birds are no pattern.</p>

<p>I once collected a pair of love-birds in London, and
fetched them home. I thought they would do well in
the nursery to teach the young idea how to love. One
day Mr. Lovebird got loose and flew about the room
until at last he found a perch out of reach in a hook
in the ceiling from which was suspended a swing. The
hook was kept well greased, and what with friction and
dust he could not have found a handier place for disguising
himself as a blackbird. To get him down the
nurse hit upon the brilliant idea of dipping a stick in
treacle, and poking about with this to entice him down,
with the result that he got treacled as well as vaselined.
At length he was caught, and put under the bathroom
tap by my better half, who was rewarded by having
his beak through the best half of her thumb. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
I came home to lunch, on learning what had happened,
I flew to the nursery, and then I saw something that
looked akin to “L” on one end of the perch, looking
very down in the feather, while Mrs. L. was at the other
end. I enquired, “Lovey, why don’t you get on with
your loving.” When swallowing a tear he answered,
“She won’t let me, cos I’m sticky.” I said, “Oh,
that’s foolish; if you love one another you should stick
together whatever happens.”</p>

<p>I gave them to a local bird dealer eventually, and
the last I saw of them they were playing about with
some rabbits. This man came up to cure a Plymouth
Rock rooster which I thought had the gout; he wrung
its neck, and that is what I would like to do with those
wriggling skylarks which have caused me all this trouble.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Hello&mdash;what’s this?” In reply the broker just
said “Two.” Of course he meant the price of the
plate, but I referred to the portrait; on my explaining
he only answered, “Don’t ask me.” I felt sure it was
intended for Tennyson, for although we writers are a
bit jealous, we soon get to know one another. I wanted
my impression confirmed, so I enquired of No. 1, “Who
do you think this is?” “Oh, that’s Sir Stafford Northcote;
I can tell by his beard.” No. 2 said it was “Garibaldi,”
judging by his necktie. Then I considered,
who do I know who runs a beard, because anyone who
flies a kite at this angle usually trims it <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</i> somebody,
and so I thought of my friend the librarian. He has
plenty of whiskers on his face, a store of information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
in his head, and much more on his shelves, and it’s
no use having a lot of shelves if you store everything
in the brain. He thought it might be Tennyson and
yet it had a look of Browning; it had rather too much
beard for Tennyson. I pointed out that at intervals
beards were usually trimmed, and he, whilst stroking
his own, agreed with me. He kindly produced volumes
which gave Tennyson from photographs, woodcuts, and
steel engravings, taken at various times, and the beard
seemed to change after each poem; in the end I came
away firmly convinced it was Tennyson, and he didn’t
seem to mind who it was. I know that Tennyson was
born in 1809, and the plate was made before 1867 by
Copeland, otherwise the mark would be “Copeland
and Son,” so if we call the plate sixty years old, we
find that the great poet was honoured by a halo of
Willow Pattern when he was about fifty, and that is
as near as one can guess to with such an illustration.
I need hardly say that Tennyson was not the writer
of that much-whistled and enticing poem “Tit-willow,
Tit-willow, Tit-willow.”</p>

<p>I thought I had done with Willow Pattern, but
the arrival of Tennyson has caused a flutter in the
dove-cot. When I came to arrange a photograph for
this book I found he was out of place in any position
for making an artistic group worthy to grace a
standard work on the Willow Pattern such as this
aspires to be. I therefore went through&mdash;or to be
more accurate took up a position in front of&mdash;my
collection, and seeing a set of Leeds bread dishes with
beaded edges, found they were all too large. (By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
way, these have no warblers on their design.) Then I
saw an oval pie-dish by Job Meigh and Son, and thought
that was no match; next I caught sight of a pair of
dishes by the so-called Wedgwood and Co. of Stockton-on-Tees,
but neither of those would fit the space. A small
pickled-onion holder, shaped like a flat-bottomed boat
or barge, was hardly dignified enough, especially as
the futurist artist had given his coots two wings and
two tails each. I was on the point of throwing up
the sponge&mdash;which, of course, I did not have with me&mdash;when
I espied on the top shelf a hot-water plate
with an antique cork in the hole. This I thought very
suitable, for had I not heard an ode to the odour of a
cork by a poet who had lost his licence? Also the lapwings
looked fairly normal. Perhaps they were tired
with having had such warm times and fidgeting about
trying to find a cool corner on a round surface. Anyway,
they did not look like nesting in that beard and
thereby upsetting the growth of years.</p>

<p>I must decline to discuss the matter further.</p>

<p>Enobarbus said of Cleopatra, “Age cannot wither
her, nor custom stale her infinite variety,” and the
sentiment embodied in this remark seems singularly
applicable to china. Year after year it wears the same
charm and beauty if taken care of, while we see evidence
of its infinite variety every day. To the amateurs who
are desirous of gathering together a collection let me
remind them that “a little knowledge is a dangerous
thing.”</p>

<p>I was recently examining a teapot, the only mark
on which was “25s.” in ink, and on commenting on
the price to a lady who was also looking round, was
amused at her remark that “it did not seem excessive
if it was either hard or soft Lowestoft.” I did not
argue the point, but it came into my mind that I had
read that the furnaces at Lowestoft were never capable
of firing hard China. Moreover, I had seen an identical
teapot in a shop about a mile away, and I have
one almost identical labelled “Newhall” and marked
“N” (<i>see</i> Shelf 3, <a href="#PLATE_XLII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XLII</span></a>, facing p. 136); also
Lowestoft china is very scarce. I believe if all the china
which has been, and still is being, offered as Lowestoft
had been made at that small early factory it would
have necessitated its being many times larger than
Doulton’s is to-day.</p>

<p>These remarks caused me to reflect on the difficulty
I experienced in learning to distinguish between hard
and soft china, as I had no desire to collect any but
old English. I read that the surest way was to use
a file, but I always feared antique dealers might resent
my testing their stock in this effective manner, although
it would have been a useful tip for some who have
sold me pieces of Chelsea and called them Oriental.
I have for some time been fitted with a thumb-nail of
experience on which I have to rely. As illustrative of
what may be “won by waiting” let me relate the
following:</p>

<p>In the year 1912 I was in Harrogate and had a desire
to acquire a blue-and-white china sauce-boat, and I
found one which the dealer and I agreed must be Lowestoft.
The price was high, but he advised me to buy,
as I might not find another. Seven years after I was
struck with the strange appearance of another blue-and-white
sauce-boat which I bought for a nominal
sum. I found it bore a faintly impressed mark, and
this enabled me to identify it as made at Bow and
printed at Battersea. This discovery led to another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
which I think worth recording. In 1912 among other
pieces I purchased a triangular-shaped tray with fretted
sides, and not being able to locate its origin said nothing
when I found it had been appropriated for use in the
bathroom as a receptacle for soap. When I had labelled
the Bow sauce-boat, which was made of a thick body
with a yellowish cast, I looked through my collection
for anything like it and found a small blue-and-white
saucer and the tray which had been desecrated with
soap instead of decorated with sweetmeats and consigned
to the risks of a bathroom instead of the safety
of the display cabinet. Pursuing my investigation I
turned out an oblong basket-work pattern dish with
quaint fret edge and with every evidence of old age,
which had been in my cupboard for nearly ten years,
and then realised that it also was early Bow.</p>

<p>You will see on <a href="#PLATE_XV">Plate <span class="smcap2">XV</span></a> a 9-inch Bow bowl of
the famille rose design; this appeared in an auctioneer’s
catalogue as “Oriental bowl” and was knocked down
for half a crown to a broker who took a profit of one
shilling from me for his bargain.</p>

<p>Here is another incident:</p>

<p>“Will you buy that bowl?”</p>

<p>“Well hardly, but I don’t mind making you a
sporting offer for the rivets,” I said.</p>

<p>These were the oldest type of rivets used for china
I had seen, and they, with some very ancient shellac,
held the two halves very firmly together. My offer
was accepted, and I do not mind telling you the bowl
is early Bow and the only piece with green in the decoration
I have ever seen. (<i>See</i> <a href="#PLATE_XV">Plate <span class="smcap2">XV</span></a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall not attempt to place values on any of my
specimens as it seems to me they are worth just as
much as I could get for them, while the same theory
holds good in buying.</p>

<p>I show on <a href="#PLATE_XLI">Plate <span class="smcap2">XLI</span></a>, Shelf 1, a cup and saucer which
are marked with cross swords; the matched cup and
saucer were sold to me by a dealer as Dresden for about
10s., whereas an odd saucer, also with cross swords (Shelf
3, <a href="#PLATE_XLII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XLII</span></a>), was sent to me marked “4d.” with some
other china, mostly rubbish, on approval. These three
items might have belonged to the same set, and are
excellent examples of the beautiful hand decoration
turned out at Bristol about the end of the 18th century.</p>

<p>I was changing trains at a station and had some
short time to wait, so I strolled into the principal street
of a town that is constantly visited by dealers or their
representatives, when I espied in a secondhand furniture
shop a pair of hand-painted dark-blue lidded pots
which at first glance I thought were Chinese ginger
jars, and yet I desired to make closer acquaintance.
On enquiring from the girl what was the price she shortly
returned and said: “She has been asking three-and-six
for them, but she will take two-and-six.” The
pots and lids were quite thick, and I could make nothing
of them in the train; but when I got home, and in a
dark room switched on the electric light, turned them
round until I came to a part thin enough to be transparent,
then by the cast of the paste I knew they were
what I anticipated, real Old Worcester teapots.</p>

<p>This reminds me of another adventure when I passed
a shop on my way to catch a train, and noticed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
window a blotchy blue and white teapot and felt sorry
I was tied to time. About three months after, I had
occasion to visit the town again, and my business being
finished I went straight to that window, when to my joy
the teapot was still there. A very short examination
and I had made up my mind to have it although it
was minus a lid.</p>

<p>On asking the price I was told 1s., but&mdash;bless their
honesty!&mdash;they wouldn’t guarantee it was old. That
teapot will be found among my Lowestoft group and
it is probably the earliest example.</p>

<p>I will here refer to the Liverpool teapot on Shelf 3,
<a href="#PLATE_XLI">Plate <span class="smcap2">XLI</span></a>. I had travelled by train to a town about
twenty miles off and there called in a shop kept by a
man whom his most intimate acquaintances might
have found to be one of the best, but to my mind
had some of the Stone Age blood in him, for he was
indeed a hard case. I asked how much for the teapot.</p>

<p>“Five shillings to you.”</p>

<p>“Five shillings? Well, I’m sorry, but they ought
not to have told you.”</p>

<p>“What are you getting at?”</p>

<p>“I just thought you must know your number’s up
and that you are in training for the repentance stakes.”</p>

<p>“No sir, but I’m pleased to see you, and to be able
to offer you a bargain this time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thanks&mdash;I apologise.”</p>

<p>When I was leaving with the teapot under my arm
he added to his farewell, “You’d be surprised if you
knew how little I gave for it.”</p>

<p>This remark rankled, and I was no sooner in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
train than I carefully examined my purchase, when I
found that the spout had been snapped off clean just
where it entered the body of the pot, and had been
carefully and neatly stuck in again, and so the mysterious
outburst of genial generosity was revealed.</p>

<p>Blue and white takes my eye always, pulls me up
every time, and I fancy myself fortunate in having
so much of it in pottery and porcelain considering the
means I have adopted while collecting.</p>

<p>I do not flatter myself that I have any china of
extraordinary value, but the reader will gather from
the photographs that, taken as a whole, I have found
something worth looking for. Being wishful that the
amateur may derive assistance from my book I have
arranged several groups as specimens of various factories,
and although the photographs can give only a
poor idea of the colours, yet the style of decoration
and the shapes may be some guide. I have succeeded
in obtaining a black background by making use of
the bookcase on the bureau, which gave me a side light.
I am glad to say that all the handling, moving from place
to place, fixing on wire stands, arranging on the shelves,
shifting from one position to another, taking down
and getting back into their respective quarters has
been achieved without a chip. Beyond the annoyance
of having to arrange a grouping twice, owing to an
oversight which was not discovered until some days
after the first negative had been taken, the photography
was interesting, and I hope the result will be so to
the reader, who is recommended to use a magnifying
glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>


<h3>BOW (<a href="#PLATE_XL">PLATE XL</a>)</h3>

<p>I have drawn my bow at a venture in getting this
bag and my first shot brought in a saucer pronounced
“Worcester” which I found had an impressed Bow
workman’s mark; next I potted a saucer which was
so thick and heavy that I thought it was all pot; then
came in sight the teapot sold as “Worcester,” Dr. Wall
period, and soon after I got a small bowl, strange to
say flying under the same false colours. Other stray
shots account for the odd handle-less cups. All these
are hand-painted in blue, and as they vary in shade
and hardness of paste they have been very entertaining.
The tea-caddy on which I placed a small cup inverted,
and two cups with saucers are painted in red, blue and
gold. I have already spoken of my large bowl, the
bowl with green decoration, sauce-boat, fretted bon-bon
tray and basket pattern dish, so I need not again refer
to them.</p>


<h3>CHELSEA (<a href="#PLATE_XXXIX">PLATE XXXIX</a>)</h3>

<p>I fancy the two cups hand-decorated in red were
among the first pieces made, and I wonder what has
become of the saucers for they would be so thick they
would not be likely to be broken except by a twentieth-century
washer-up. I have three large plates, two of
which were sold as Oriental, while the other was exchanged
for a remark about the weather and half a
crown. The two small plates were “certainly Lowestoft.”
The fine cup I found at Dunbar, and strange
to say I picked out a saucer to match it at a Southport
shop a few days later. Here I also bought the little
vase as Oriental, and at the next antique shop I visited
I was kindly furnished with an Oriental lid which fitted,
thus completing the picture in a way. The Chelsea
painting is exquisite, yet the whole does not bear careful
scrutiny. Still the two make handy examples of
hard and soft paste. The odd cup dates between the
cups already spoken of. The small figure of Cupid
holding a shell for sweets completes the group, but an
early bowl will be found on <a href="#PLATE_XV">Plate <span class="smcap2">XV</span></a>.</p>

<h3>LOWESTOFT (<a href="#PLATE_XL">PLATE XL</a>)</h3>

<p>Before you set out to collect Lowestoft it would be
as well if you learned something about it, for as no
marks are known of in connection therewith it makes
a most convenient name to conjure with. I have had
all sorts of stuff offered to me as Lowestoft. After I
had coached myself up I rambled out one day to endeavour
to make a start and you will scarcely credit
it but at the first shop I came to I was successful. After
going through the china that was visible I worked my
way to the back where I found a few plates and odds
and ends jumbled together, and after turning them
over came across the pair of small blue hand-painted
plates shown. I was told the plates had been in the
window ever so long, but as nobody wanted them I
could have them for a shilling each. I have found
the other two odd plates quite at haphazard, and they
were treated as just ordinary old ware by people who
have not sunk deep into the mysteries of porcelain and
glazing. Three cups and a saucer in blue, also a cup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and saucer with basket and garland floral decoration
in colours, make up the lot after including the teapot
to which I have already alluded as probably one of the
earliest pieces, owing to the way in which the design
had run causing its smudged appearance. The handle-less
cup may be Longton Hall.</p>


<h3>BRISTOL</h3>

<p>To the group Shelf 3, <a href="#PLATE_XLII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XLII</span></a>, I think it worth while
to call special attention. To begin with I invested
one shilling on the handle-less cup blue and gold, marked
“T,” and I concluded this identified it with Tebo and
Bristol; next I was sold the blue-and-white coffee
cup marked with crossed swords and guaranteed
“Worcester”; then I bought the spill-holder with
crossed swords. All these at different times and places.
Later I spotted a dirty teapot, with no mark and no
gilt, which when washed looked well. It was evidently
closely related to the coffee-cup in decoration and age,
and was undoubtedly old Bristol. Then my faith in the
“T” mark wavered, and when a few days after I
saw a feeding-cup which appeared new, and which on
handling revealed the “T” again, I began to feel cheap.
Anyway, this settled the doubt I had in my mind and
convinced me that while I had found an old Bristol
piece which had copied the Dresden mark I had been
deceived by “Dresden” faking the old Bristol mark.
I show the two wastrels alongside the absolutes to
illustrate my perplexity; certainly the soft paste, hand
decoration, and very little gilt remaining helped to
take me down. I wonder which of the copyists originated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the design? “T” on this class has meant taboo
since.</p>

</div></div></div>


<p>The first Bristol cottage china teapot (Shelf 2)
I discovered was on a shelf and as I lifted it down I
noticed the cross mark in red, and as no lid was in evidence
I was charged one shilling. On wrapping it up I found
the lid inside and called attention thereto, but was
met with the remark “That makes no difference.”</p>


<h3>MINTON (SHELF 1, <a href="#PLATE_XLI">PLATE XLI</a>)</h3>

<p>I am noticing this name because thereby hangs
a tale. While in a well-stocked shop I was charmed
with a cup and saucer, which I examined and found
impressed “Minton,” together with the name of the
artist, and dated 1864 in red. At the time of my find
(1912), this artist had risen to the important position
of Art Director at &mdash;&mdash;, and I wondered why he had
gone to such trouble to please someone whose initials
are worked into the design on the cup and saucer, and
how it came to be sold to me with the remark, “Oh,
that’s only modern; you can have it for&mdash;&mdash;” (so little),
as it is hand painted with sweet delicacy. The plate
is a typical example of hand-painted fruit, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
border of turquoise blue. Further specimens are on
Shelf 1, <a href="#PLATE_XLII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XLII</span></a>, a Minton plate giving a Spanish
noble’s coat-of-arms in green, and a rather ordinary cup
and saucer in pink and turquoise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Owing to a very recent purchase just in time to be
included in <a href="#PLATE_XXXIII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XXXIII</span></a>, Shelf 1, there will be seen two
Minton Plates; the one in the centre is pottery, is mainly
hand painted in bright colours, one over the glaze, and
impressed “Minton.” That on the right is thick porcelain
with one colour over the glaze, the outline of the
design in black transfer, the colouring done by hand.
I have had a pair of the latter some time, and the marked
plate confirmed my opinion that they also came from the
same factory, so I included one for the benefit of the
reader, who will do well to study old Minton. Because&mdash;I
have just been pulled up short when passing a shop
which exhibited a large dish (20 in. by 15½ in.), having
been struck by its almost dazzling decoration and its
perfect condition. I found it bore no maker’s mark,
but as I had Minton’s style in my mind’s eye, I bought
it in a hurry as pottery. Now I have time to examine it
at home I find it is excellent porcelain, translucent
throughout, although it weighs 6½ lb. It is the largest
piece of china I have and the most brilliant in colouring,
which is all hand painted, being touched up here and there
with dark brown for a finishing effect after glazing.
There is enough work on this dish to keep a “Ca’ Canny”
artist (did such exist) toiling for a week. It is a greatly
glorified edition of the marked plate, and it is just in time
to be too late to photograph, as this is my final haul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
before going to press. Here is another proof of my
previous remark that “You never know your luck when
collecting,” but I must add that your fortune may be
considerably influenced by the knowledge you have
acquired. You should first of all make up your mind
where you want to go, and ascertain the best way to
“get there,” as there are many pitfalls on the road.
The six plates referred to have been found at five different
places (the pair 100 miles away); and as to the cost, well,
that is a detail which might depreciate the descriptive
notes.</p>


<h3>SWANSEA (<a href="#PLATE_XLI">PLATE XLI</a>)</h3>

<p>I must say a few words about this group, as second on
the left is a jug which represents my first purchase in old
china. I knew nothing about the subject, and when
later I discovered its mark “Woodbine” denoted that
the piece emanated from Swansea, and that it was
actually mentioned in a book, it set me thinking, and
I decided to enter for the China Stakes. I have gathered
in other Swansea representatives, none of them of a
really uncommon type. Four in the centre are lustre
decoration, but no one I have come in contact with
has been aware that it was all Swansea, so possibly
the photograph may be of avail to more than one curious
reader. I am well aware that the really artistic Swansea
is considered of great value, but the fact that I
have no specimens of this class does not keep me awake
o’ nights. The jug on the right is Nantgarw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>


<h3>BLUE DRAGON (<a href="#PLATE_XL">PLATE XL</a>)</h3>

<p>I had a remarkable experience one morning when
I was staying at a seaside town. I turned out to see
what I could find, and visited all likely shops. In
one where the stock was mostly modern I was told
they had no old china, but for some reason I opened
a drawer near the door and lifted out a blue dragon
bowl bearing an old Worcester mark. They had forgotten
all about it, and seemed almost as pleased as
I was at the discovery, which ended in a mutual bargain.
In another street at a shop where they were
giving up business, and only had a little stock left, I
saw another blue dragon bowl the same size, marked
4s. 6d. When I got home I removed the price ticket
and was shocked when an imitation Chinese mark was
revealed proving it to be very early Caughley. No
blue dragons or blue devils have since crossed my path,
but if I do meet with any green dragons on cups I will
see if I cannot make them agree with some which are
portrayed on the two early Coalport saucers I show
on <a href="#PLATE_XLI">Plate <span class="smcap2">XLI</span></a>.</p>


<h3>WORCESTER (SHELVES 3 AND 4, <a href="#PLATE_XL">PLATE XL</a>)</h3>

<p>Reader, I have now brought you to Worcester,
which you know is a Sauce-y as well as a Saucer-y
place, but that should not influence our careful study
of some of its products which appeal to me effectively.
There is something so reposeful about the blue-and-white
old Worcester china, mellow with age, and soothing
with its smoothness, combined with a warmth of
feeling, that has ofttimes affected me. When reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the stage of jadedness after a long ramble, when the
results have been up to that point disappointing, I
have felt quite revived after treating myself to a taste
of Worcester Sauce. You see the variety of articles, wine
cup, egg-cup, sweetmeat dish, teapot, cups and saucers&mdash;but
I wish to call your special attention to the small
jug. I saw one very like this recently fitted with a lid,
and marked with a crescent, which the dealer said denoted
either Worcester or Caughley, and the price was four
guineas. As my jug has no mark I call it “Worcester.”
The cup and saucer, lotus pattern bear the 1862 mark.</p>

<p>Shelf 3, <a href="#PLATE_XLI">Plate <span class="smcap2">XLI</span></a>, coloured and printed Worcester.
I bought the English Japanese mask jug, as I was struck
with its doubtful beauty, especially as it had only part
of the handle. Later it took a journey to London, and
returned after a lengthy absence fitted with the artificial
limb which, as it has not been put to use since, has
proved most satisfactory.</p>

<p>With regard to the coloured cream jug, on one of
my cycling rambles I unexpectedly came across an
emporium, stocked with a legion of antiques, which I
entered, after dismounting of course. Being a beginner
I was much bewildered, and was backing out without
buying when I was hypnotised by the glare of the proprietor’s
gaze, so I grabbed the most strikingly coloured
thing that struck my eye, put down half a crown, and
scorched away with what I have since discovered to
be a piece of old Worcester of a type which is in great
demand. I got to know the man fairly well later, and
if he had sudden fits of uncontrollable temper at intervals
his lungs were O. K., and fitted him for the role of local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
politician. He did a big trade, and if I caught him in
his shirt with his trousers fastened up by his braces
tied round him I anticipated we could do business;
but on occasions when I found him got up in print
shirt-sleeves and a black velveteen waistcoat then I
knew he was expecting wealthy clients and I had better
call again. His knowledge of marks was somewhat
limited, and I wondered why his price always seemed
high after I had examined the bottom of a piece; and
that he never said what he wanted until he had taken
the thing from me and satisfied himself if it had a mark
or not. When I tumbled to his game, if I caught sight
of a mark I had to put that piece back hurriedly and
pick it up again casually just before leaving, this being
a case of paste cutting a rough diamond.</p>

<p>Lastly I come to my first little bit of Worcester.
You will no doubt have heard of Dr. Wall, who really
created this china; if not, you can read him up, when
you will find he took a great interest in Malvern, so
it is not surprising that on this mug there is a view of
Malvern. Judging by the scene it must be a very early
production, more especially as the printing is over the
glaze. Every collector seems to be out for reminiscences
of Dr. Wall, and I once came in contact with a dealer
who labelled most of his Worcester “Dr. Wal period.”
On my pointing out the error in the spelling he remarked,
“I see&mdash;that makes a L of a difference!”</p>


<h3>NEWHALL</h3>

<p>It is often hard to tell a certain class of Newhall
from Bristol common or cottage china, and Newhall
seems to have turned out many qualities of work without
using any mark. The only pieces I have which are
marked are the bowl on “Grandfather Helm” and the
teapot in <a href="#PLATE_XLII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XLII</span></a>, Shelf 3.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>In regard to the bowl I am about to reveal a secret
known to very few outside my own family circle. The
bowl was given (not thrown) in with several other things
I had bought, as it had a piece broken out. It is gaudily
painted inside, and having the letter “N” on the bottom
I determined to make the most of it. I had a wooden
block cut, grooved to just fit the jagged edge when
the bowl was on its side, and fitted with a back support
which took in the bottom, then a piece of wire
holds the bowl always in position. This is a bit of
camouflage that has only been noticed by one collector
visitor, and the bowl has often been admired. On the top
shelf, <a href="#PLATE_XLI">Plate <span class="smcap2">XLI</span></a>, you will see two teapots very similar
in decoration, the practically perfect one is Newhall
and soft; the other, without a handle, is Chinese and
very hard. I bought the latter to demonstrate how
nearly the English artist copied the Oriental, but the
faces always give the show away; the fact is, you cannot
make a Chinese mug out of an English face. When
I bought this broken pot the following remarks were
exchanged:</p>

<p>“I never thought anyone would be soft enough to
buy that thing.”</p>

<p>“Ah! but I collect teapots without handles; then
they cannot be broken off when they are used at home.”</p>

<p>“But how can they pour the tea out when it’s hot?”</p>

<p>“Pump it out with a strainer.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now you are pumping. If you get any more without
handles, will you save them for me? Good day.”</p>


<h3>DERBY (SHELF 4, <a href="#PLATE_XXXIX">PLATE XXXIX</a>)</h3>

<p>The cup and saucer on the right are richly decorated
in heavy gold only, and are marked. Those at
the left end are painted with rural scenery, and I was
surprised to find they were Derby. The part-set of
handsome Crown Derby will be easily identified by the
typical handwork, which is of good early production.</p>


<h3>SPODE (SHELVES 2 AND 3, <a href="#PLATE_XXXIX">PLATE XXXIX</a>)</h3>

<p>I give several specimens representing this prolific
factory, and although none of them is marked, I feel
sure they are correctly classified. There is a substantial
portion of a family tea service of old Spode on the
third shelf, to which I have added some cups and
saucers of the same design, but whiter in the body.
These all have the well-known Mandarin design as
decoration with the typical bright green in evidence.
The teapot, sugar bowl, and specimen cups and saucers
on the shelf below call for no special comment.</p>


<h3>LEEDS</h3>

<p>I give on Shelf 1, <a href="#PLATE_XLI">Plate <span class="smcap2">XLI</span></a>, a charming specimen
of some cups and saucers printed in maroon and gilt,
and on Shelf 1, <a href="#PLATE_XLII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XLII</span></a>, a blue-and-white cup and
saucer bearing a square imitation Chinese mark. On
“Grandfather Phillips,” Plate <span class="smcap2">III</span>, there is an example
of old Leeds pottery, hand painted in blue, with an
early Oriental design. I was in doubt where this bowl
emanated from, but I am now convinced it is Leeds, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
I have just bought a perfect rich blue-and-white Leeds
Queen’s ware coffee pot of similar design and glaze.
It has a twin twisted handle with flower knob, and cost
less than the price of this book. A basket-pattern dish
in fine condition appears on <a href="#PLATE_XV">Plate <span class="smcap2">XV</span></a>.</p>


<h3>FRENCH PORCELAIN</h3>

<p>At the head of <a href="#PLATE_XLII">Plate <span class="smcap2">XLII</span></a> you will see a covered potpourri
jar and a pair of 8-inch beakers, together with two
mugs. I found four of these things at Folkestone, while one
mug, with the coat-of-arms of the Earl of Arundel worked
into the decoration, I got in Kendal. When I was in
Folkestone in 1912 I was hopelessly puzzled as to what
this stuff could be. In another shop I had examined
a bowl of the same make bearing an imitation Chinese
mark, and as up to then I had learnt that only English
china was soft&mdash;which all these pieces were&mdash;I could
not understand where it came from. After comparing
notes with Mr. J. F. Blacker, who had previously written
me very kindly when answering my queries, I felt satisfied
it was made in France of a soft quality to suit the
English market. The decoration is by hand, and is a
mixture between Chelsea and Oriental design. Lots of
this stuff has been called Lowestoft, and about that
time in an up-to-date shop I saw something like it which
I felt sure had not long come over from the Continent.
Soon after this holiday I was asked to call at a house
near home to look at two “Lowestoft” vases which
had just been sent them, and I found they were similar
modern Continental. I believe my specimens are about
a hundred years old.</p>

<h2 id="SEVENTH_COURSE"><i>SEVENTH COURSE</i><br />
Old Horse Amulets</h2>

<div class="ch">

<p>A Poor Start&mdash;Castings&mdash;Tips&mdash;Duplicates&mdash;Photographs&mdash;A
Puzzle&mdash;My only Son&mdash;Our last Tour.</p></div>


<p>I have now reached a course which I am afraid I shall
not find easy-going. My attention was first drawn to
horse amulets or face brasses in an article in the <cite>Connoisseur</cite>
for October, 1911, but it was not until 1913,
when I came in touch with the proprietor of an antique
shop who had dabbled in these things for some time,
and who obligingly talked to me about them, that I
decided I would add a few to my collection, as they
might be interesting and would occupy small space.
My first purchases resulted in my bringing home on
approval quite a number which I had obtained from a
dealer, who informed me that the brasses were usually
collected in pairs. I referred this find to the friendly
antique proprietor, who, after looking them through,
asked if I had paid for them, and he said it in such a
way that I evaded the question by enquiring “Why?”
His answer was, “Because there are several stamped
pieces, and you should only buy cast ones; besides,
what do you want pairs for?”</p>

<p>This seemed rather a poor start, but I was taught
early in life to make difficulties stepping-stones to success,
so I returned the amulets not approved of, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
later received desirable specimens in exchange. The
next step was to learn how to detect those that were
cast, and I found they usually had a couple of points
or studs apparent at the back corresponding with the
holes in the moulds through which the molten metal
had been run. Further, all stamped pieces are punched
out of a sheet of brass, the same thickness throughout,
the back of which is practically as smooth as the front.
I have about half a dozen not cast and not stamped,
but fretted by hand.</p>

<p>Next I had to ascertain how to tell old from modern.
That can usually be arrived at by the appearance of
wear, while the old type are more highly finished and
better metal was used in their manufacture. I was
soon made aware of the fact that new “old” pieces
were being made, as they were constantly cropping up.
The ambition of the collector evidently should be to
get together as many varieties as possible, leaving the
duplicates for other buyers; but as soon as my curiosity
was aroused I bought all the old castings I came across.</p>

<p>To anyone who makes a special study of signs and
symbols these patterns and designs must be very fascinating,
and the collecting thereof should appeal forcibly
to those with enquiring minds whose fancies tend in
that direction.</p>

<p>As it was quite impossible to get together a collection
by my usual method of looking out for myself, I secured
the assistance of two kindly travellers who went in all
directions in connection with their ordinary business.
They took great interest in my requirement, and bought
up all the old brass cast specimens they could find, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the result that I became possessed of many duplicates,
some of which I disposed of, whilst through the courtesy
of a correspondent who readily exchanged the remainder,
I was able to raise the number of my different specimens
to about four hundred.</p>

<p>I found these amulets made very interesting groups
for photography, and as fast as I procured a fresh two
dozen I hung them by strong pins on a bridge table,
which I placed on its side on a dining-table, and so
was enabled to make an easy job. I was quite keen
up to a point on doing this, but the bottom seemed
to drop out of the business soon after the war started,
though not before I had taken quite a number of photographs.
In the hope they will interest many readers,
I give two plates reduced from twelve of my best negatives,
which will show enough amulets for anyone to
be going on with. One collector informed me he knew
of over one thousand designs, and no doubt there are
many more, so there is ample scope, but my experience
is that old specimens are very hard to find.</p>

<p>I am now going to put a puzzle before you, and hope
it may be somewhat entertaining. The fact is, one of
the amulets is a fake. It occupies a central position
on one of the twelve photographs reproduced. I conceived
the idea when the spirit of mischief was upon
me, and with the assistance of a mechanic and a little
solder, a very common piece was made into a very
rare specimen. It was specially remarked upon by
another collector to whom I sent my photographs as
the only one of the kind he had seen. Which is it?</p>

<p>I remember showing this jokingly to my son, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>his characteristic comment was, “That’s jolly good;
but I say, dad, is it playing the game?”</p>

<p>In the spring of 1914 my son took me in his side-car
for a tour which lasted one happy week, one day
of which now comes forcibly to my mind. That we
started back from Henley-on-Thames in pouring rain
made no difference to his equable temper, and before
we reached Oxford the sun was as bright as his disposition.
When we turned at Whitney and passed over
the Cotswolds <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for the Wye Valley, we came
across the scenery in which he revelled, and here he
and I found a few old amulets in a saddler’s shop while
waiting for the wayside lunch. In peace and quietness
his true bent lay, and only his regard for duty
impelled him to join the Army when volunteers were
appealed for. His commission was dated on his twenty-first
birthday, and it was the irony of fate that the
last two years of his clean life should have been spent
in the grime and stress and turmoil of war. Thus I
lost my lovable companion, who for nearly ten years
had played such a charming part in assisting to make
my collecting a pastime.</p>

<h2 id="FINAL_COURSE"><i>FINAL COURSE</i><br />
Sheffield Plate and Old Silver
Told by the Plateau</h2>


<p>I have been asked to act as spokesman for this group
and as it is in the customary order of things, not only
for every group but for each individual, to have a grievance
and air it, I must first of all protest against the
indignity of placing my companions and myself at the
rear of the book, when our value and appearance justify
our occupying the premier position, and we consider
it a great slight on the estimation in which we are held
by real connoisseurs that we have been allotted a back
setting while things like old pewter, for which we have
the utmost contempt, have been allocated to the forefront.
Now that I am on my feet I will say a few words
respecting my associates and myself, and considering
that my age and reflections extend over a century, I
hope they will be followed with some regard. I get on
very well with the Tankard, but there are times when
he gets out of hand. On one of these unruly outbursts
he addressed me as “Centrepiece,” but I metaphorically
put his lid on by calling him “a mug.” Taking
him all round, he is not a bad specimen, and undoubtedly
has sprung from a good family, although I have heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
that he latterly came out of a pawnshop for half a
sovereign.</p>

<p>My friends the candlesticks might assist me considerably
in my reflections, but their glory has been
snuffed out since coming here, and on no occasion have
they served any useful purpose, whereas if their telescopic
action was brought into play and their proper
office as candle-bearers to a distinguished specimen
bearing the aristocratic title of “Tableau” was allotted
to them, they would undoubtedly throw more light on
this subject.</p>

<p>The cake-basket is the silent member of our select
clique, but I learnt that it had served a fine family for
some generations, when it was presented to a church
bazaar. From there it passed into the warm hands of
the late donor to our present owner. In my opinion
this is a case of overfretting.</p>

<p>The sugar-tongs and butter-knife are quite unobtrusive,
but are of sterling worth. They often indulge in
punctilious conversation which usually becomes more
animated in the afternoon about tea-time, when they
often refer to a family of Spoons&mdash;the Tea Spoons, I
believe. On these occasions Mr. Knife lays the butter
on rather thickly, which Miss Tongs in her sweet way
appears to look upon as quite the correct thing. Only
on her arrival here in company with the Cream Jug
have I seen them upset, and I gathered that they had
all their lives been accustomed to the troy weight which
jewellers use, but owing to the vicissitudes of their
recent experience they had fallen into the hands of a
broker, who, when he parted with them, dumped them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
into the scales which were guaranteed to weigh correctly
up to 14 lb. avoirdupois, and which had just been used
for dirty pewter and called them “half a crown an
ounce.”</p>

<p>The Cream Jug keeps himself to himself, and is taciturn,
at times turning to sourness. He suffers from
swelled head occasionally, and then says things about
“hall-marks” and “helmet shape,” but he always
carries himself well. We call the Toddy ladle “Euclid,”
because he is length without breadth, but he doesn’t
mind. He has had jovial times in the past, and says
if he were to tell me some of the tales he has heard when
he was kept busy at nights that I should crack my
mirror. He loves to lie on me with his face downwards,
as then he can see it in the glass, and I will say I have
seldom seen a nicer.</p>

<p>As regards myself, I could fill a volume with the
interesting events I have witnessed and the conversations
I have heard, but the space placed at my disposal
is so meagre I will limit my disclosures to the last few
years of my existence. Owing to circumstances over
which I had no control, after a lengthy period of neglect
I was condemned to occupy an undignified position in
a broker’s window, where the odour of paraffin was
most repulsive to my susceptibilities. I was dozing in
the dark one evening when I heard a voice inquiring,
“Have you any pewter?” and the reply, “There is a
thing in the window, but I think it has some copper
about it.” Some money changed hands, I was wrapped
in soiled paper and carried to this home, where I was
shocked to see a lot of horrid pewter in the hall and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
elsewhere, and I was introduced to the family in this
way, “I don’t know what it is, but it is juicy
heavy.”</p>

<p>These people treated me with an attention I had
not been accustomed to for many years, and after giving
my frame a bath and a polish, refitting my mirror top
and screwing my mahogany back, promoted me to the
drawing-room, where no pewter was permitted to enter,
and here I have since remained. I am convinced I
never looked better, and they went into ecstasies over
my grape and vine leaves border decoration, and I then
had my photograph taken for the first time in my life.
Being a great advocate of cleanliness, and as the same
care was bestowed on my appearance in my early days
as now, I was quite in accord with the lady who remarked,
“She thought that in all well-managed houses
the carpets ought to be taken up and beaten at least
once a year.”</p>

<p>Do you know I love old furniture, and on occasions
when there is a general dust up in the drawing-room
I am walked past an elm dresser on which I have
caught sight of a pair of Sheffield plate snuffers. I
have cut them dead, as I notice they have so far demeaned
themselves as to form an unholy alliance with
a despicable pewter tray.</p>

<p>I had an uneventful period until the leaves were falling
in 1918, when a young captain in khaki arrived straight
from the firing line in France on leave for a fortnight.
The next few days I am proud to say I had to bear
the weight of a large wedding cake, and on the eventful
day I trembled when the bride began to cut it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the captain assisting her, but my old back, which is as
strong as ever, bore up bravely. There was much
talking on that occasion, but the words which most
impressed me&mdash;and which, in order that I may apply
them to my patient readers, shall be my last&mdash;were</p>
